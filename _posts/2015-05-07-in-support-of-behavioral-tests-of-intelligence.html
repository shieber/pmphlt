<p>Alan Turing proposed what is the best known criterion for attributing intelligence, the capacity for thinking, to a computer. We call it <a href="http://theturingtest.com/">the Turing Test</a>, and it involves comparing the computer’s verbal behavior to that of people. If the two are indistinguishable, the computer passes the test. This might be cause for attributing intelligence to the computer.</p>
<p>Or not. The best argument <em>against</em> a behavioral test of intelligence (like the Turing Test) is that maybe the exhibited behaviors were just memorized. This is Ned Block’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockhead_(computer_system)">“blockhead” argument</a> in a nutshell. If the computer just had all its answers literally encoded in memory, then parroting those memorized answers is no sign of intelligence. And how are we to know from a behavioral test like the Turing Test that the computer <em>isn’t</em> just such a “memorizing machine”?</p>
<p>In my new(ish) paper, “<a href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11684156">There can be no Turing-Test–passing memorizing machines</a>”, I address this argument directly. My conclusion can be found in the title of the article. By careful calculation of the information and communication capacity of space-time, I show that any memorizing machine could pass a Turing Test of no more than a few seconds, which is no Turing Test at all. Crucially, I make no assumptions beyond the brute laws of physics. (One distinction of the article is that it is one of the few philosophy articles in which a derivative is taken.)</p>
<p>The article is published in the open access journal <em><a href="http://www.philosophersimprint.org/">Philosophers’ Imprint</a></em>, and is <a href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11684156">available here</a> along with code to computer-verify the calculations.</p>
