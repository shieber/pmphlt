<a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000165">My paper</a> on the "open-access compact" is now available from <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/">PLoS Biology</a> and at <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/">my web site</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scholars write articles to be read—the more access to their articles the better—so one might think that the open-access approach to publishing, in which articles are freely available online to all without interposition of an access fee, would be an attractive competitor to traditional subscription-based journal publishing.</p>
<p>But open-access journal publishing is currently at a systematic disadvantage relative to the traditional model.</p>
<p>I propose a simple, cost-effective remedy to this inequity that would put open-access publishing on a path to become a sustainable, efficient system, allowing the two journal publishing systems to compete on a more level playing field. The issue is important, first, because academic institutions shouldn’t perpetuate barriers to an open-access business model on principle and, second, because the subscription-fee business model has manifested systemic dysfunctionalities in practice. After describing the problem with the subscription-fee model, I turn to the proposal for providing equity for open-access journal publishing—the open-access compact.</p></blockquote>
