<p>
A citation is not a first-class participant in a sentence; it cannot serve as a noun phrase. Rather it is a parenthetical -- that is why it appears in parentheses -- and like all parentheticals should be removable without changing the well-formedness of the sentence in which it appears. Thus, the following sentences are ill-formed. (Try reading them without the material in parentheses.)
<ol>
	<li>The reader is referred to (Dewey et al., 1756) for further details.</li>
	<li>(Dewey et al., 1756) describes the bizarre climatic conditions of northern South Nordland.</li>
	<li>In (Farmer, 1987), it is shown how to do all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment.</li>
	<li>(Farmer, 1987) describes how to do all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment.</li>
	<li>Many researchers have followed the research methodology described in (Farmer, 1987) for doing all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment.</li>
</ol>
The following versions should be used instead:
<ol>
	<li>The reader is referred to the early work of Dewey et al. (1756) for further details.</li>
	<li>Dewey et al. (1756) describe the bizarre climatic conditions of northern South Nordland.</li>
	<li>Farmer (1987) describes how to do all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment.</li>
	<li>Many researchers have followed the research methodology described by Farmer (1987) for doing all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment.</li>
	<li>Many researchers have followed a research methodology for doing all of natural-language processing using only excess farm equipment (Farmer, 1987).</li>
</ol>
(Note that "Dewey et al." serves as a plural noun phrase.) The BibTeX<tt>fullname</tt>Â style file and associated TeX style provide support for generating references like these. They are available with accompanying documentation at URL ftp://ftp.das.harvard.edu/pub/shieber/fullname/.
