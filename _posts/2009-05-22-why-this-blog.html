<p>This blog presents occasional writings on whatever I'm interested in at the moment, which currently includes topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>scholarly communications and open access, and other university matters</li>
<li>computer science topics of various sorts</li>
<li>language, linguistics, and computational linguistics</li>
<li>pedagogy and writing</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect that in the near term, I'll primarily be commenting on open access issues.</p>
<p>I've avoided having a blog until now becauseÂ in the past I've been constitutionally incapable of presenting my thinking in any kind of interim state. This blog is my attempt to change this archaic aspect of my personality, and to provide a venue for writings of a more exploratory or ephemeral nature. Still, I expect many posts will be relatively long as compared to a typical blog, though short compared to a scholarly article and more topical.</p>
<p>I chose the word "pamphlet" to describe these writings, as I was inspired to experiment with this style of writing by <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29673553">the pamphlets</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dodgson">Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll)</a>. The use of the word "occasional" under both of <a href="http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=occasional#O5020300">its first two senses</a> was intentional.</p>
<p>The opinions expressed here are my own. I am not speaking on behalf of Harvard or any of its constituent parts, or on behalf of anyone else for that matter.</body></html></p>
