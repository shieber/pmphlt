<p>I'm flying back from Berlin, where I gave talks at the <a href="http://ape2011.eu/">Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference</a> and the <a href="http://project-soap.eu/soap-symposium/">Study of Open Access Publishing (SOAP) Symposium</a>. Karmically, the SOAP Symposium was held in the very room, in <a href="http://www.harnackhaus-berlin.mpg.de/2316/en">Harnack Haus</a> of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Max Planck Society" href="http://www.mpg.de" rel="homepage">Max Planck Society</a>, where the <a href="http://oa.mpg.de/lang/en-uk/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities</a> was drafted in 2003. I'll post links to those talks at this site when they become available. [<strong>Update 1/31/11:</strong> Links to the talks are now available at right.]</p>
<p>These several days of listening to presentations and talking with publishers, academics, and librarians have left me, I have to say, more optimistic about the potential future of open-access publishing than I've been in many years, maybe ever. Of course, that may not be saying much; I've never been very sanguine. But at the moment I'm marginally positive.</p>
<p>Over the past years, a transition path to relatively widespread open-access publishing has been obscure at best, and progress has been slow to nonexistent. Uptake, however measured, has been grudging, and author apathy overwhelming.</p>
<p>Especially problematic, but completely understandable, is the relatively slow uptake of authors in publishing in OA journals. Part, of course, is a numbers game: there are very few open-access journals of sufficient quality to provide more than a tiny fraction of the needed capacity, and little hope at the moment of remedying that situation given the lack of a viable revenue model for OA journals; it's hard to imagine publishers starting a whole lot of OA journals if there's no revenue model to keep them going in a sustainable, scalable manner. That's the problem that <a href="http://www.oacompact.org/">COPE</a> is attempting to address. In fact, that was the topic of my SOAP Symposium keynote.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor to authors' ambivalence is their need to chase journal brand. Indeed, this is the main reason academics publish in journals — to get the imprimatur of the journal on their paper, since for better or worse (and, to my mind, mostly worse) that's often what affects their career trajectory.</p>
<p>For a long time, I've assumed that a transition to a sizable role for OA publishing will require existing publishers to switch their existing journals to an OA publication-fee revenue model in order to cover enough of the scholarly fields, because the founding of enough new journals, whether by existing publishers or new ones, is a long and unlikely process, and won't be able to address the brand development problem for even longer.</p>
<p>But recent developments may indicate a breakthrough from a surprising direction: <em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/home.action">PLoS ONE</a></em>, a new kind of open-access mega-journal. This journal has a set of interlocking characteristics: broad scope ("<a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/information.action">primary research from any scientific discipline</a>"), focused peer review for validity and soundness (but not field or predicted impact), reasonable publication fees, and post-publication article metrics and other services. Surprisingly (to me at least; I was frankly skeptical when <em>PLoS ONE</em> was launched) this model has shown tremendous popularity; submission growth has been geometric. Evidently, <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLoS</a> is able to provide a venue for verifying scientific validity over a huge range of fields and a huge number of articles, and make money doing it. <em>PLoS One</em> has become the <a href="http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.com/2011/01/plos-one-now-worlds-largest-journal.html">largest peer-reviewed journal on earth</a>, publishing almost 7,000 articles last year. It is single-handedly allowing PLoS to break even, subsidizing its higher-selectivity and field-focused journals.</p>
<p>Publishers have not failed to notice the dramatic success of <em>PLoS ONE</em>, and they are jumping on the bandwagon. <a href="http://www.sagepub.com/home.nav">SAGE</a> announced <em><a href="http://www.sageopen.com/">SAGE Open</a></em>, a mega-journal for "the social and behavioral sciences and humanities", <a href="http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/index.html">Nature Publishing Group</a> is rolling out <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificreports">Scientific Reports</a></em> (“all areas of the natural sciences— biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences”), and there's <em><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/">BMJ Open</a></em> (“medical research”), <em><a href="http://aipadvances.aip.org/">AIP Advances</a></em> (“applied research in the physical sciences”), <a href="http://www.genetics-gsa.org/">Genetics Society of America</a>’s <em><a href="http://www.g3journal.org/mission.html">G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</a></em> (“high-quality foundational research, particularly research that generates large-scale datasets”). As <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/people/publishing.php">Mark Patterson</a>, Director of Publishing for PLoS, pointed out in his talk at APE, all of these journals take up the <em>PLoS ONE</em> approach: broad scope, open access with an article-processing-fee revenue model, peer review for validity but not predicted importance or impact, post-publication article metrics and services, scalability, and a strong brand.</p>
<p>(NPG has decided not to use their trademark <em>Nature</em> in the name of their mega-journal, presumably out of fear that they would dilute the brand of their other journals. I think they are missing a strategic opportunity to strongly brand the new journal, based on a misapprehension that people primarily associate brand imprimatur with publisher journal collections rather than individual journals. <em>PLoS ONE</em> has shown that a publisher with an excellent high-quality brand association can run a mega-journal without diluting the brand signal of its flagship journals. I'd guess that sooner or later, we'll start seeing the journal referred to as <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em>, even if the name doesn't officially change.)</p>
<p>It seems extraordinarily likely that other major publishers will move in this direction as well. (You heard it here first.) [<strong>Update 5/25/11:</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/mJBuOa">Elsevier is now advertising</a> for a Scientific Editor for a journal called <em>Cell Reports</em> from Cell Press, which “will publish high quality papers across the broadest possible range of disciplines in biology. It is an open access, online-only journal with continuous publication.” Sounds like <em>PLoS ONE</em> and <em>Scientific Reports</em> to me<em>.</em>] [<strong>Update 7/7/11:</strong> <a href="http://www.ameinfo.com/269578.html">Bloomsbury has announced</a> yet another new megajournal <em><a href="http://www.authorsqscience.com/connect.html">QScience Connect</a></em> under sponsorship of the Qatar Science Foundation “for all research that is considered to be valid, ethical and correct”. Notably, they claim to cover “all fields”, including the traditional physical and life sciences, but also, math, computer science, law, the humanities, the social sciences, <a href="http://www.authorsqscience.com/QSCSubjects.txt">etc., etc.</a>] [<strong>Update 1/12/12:</strong> Joining the other major scholarly publishers, Springer has launched <em><a href="http://www.springerplus.com/">SpringerPlus</a></em>, covering "all disciplines of Science" with review based on scientific soundness alone.] [<strong>Update 1/17/12:</strong> I missed <a href="http://bit.ly/x5Nkf1">the December announcement</a> of <em>FEBS Open Bio</em>, an OA megajournal published by Elsevier on behalf of the <a href="http://www.febs.org/">Federation of Biochemical Societies</a>. The journal covers “the molecular and cellular life sciences in both health and disease” and reviews based on “soundness”, not “eventual importance”. Interestingly, this new journal would seem to compete directly with Elsevier's other OA megajournal, <em>Cell Reports</em>. How they'll handle that remains to be seen.]</p>
<p>The mega-journal trend means that strong traditional publishers with name recognition are entering open-access publishing in a big way. They'll be hard pressed to trot out their hackneyed canards (<a href="http://bit.ly/3ZTgRt">vanity press</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/hXCqld">disenfranchisement</a>). And these journals will provide coverage of a huge swathe of academic fields. Between <em>SAGE Open</em>, <em>PLoS ONE</em>, and <em>Scientific Reports</em>, essentially all of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences are covered. In addition, the breadth of these journals means that they will be competing for the same pool of articles. Authors will have a choice between submitting papers in genetics, say, to <em>PLoS One</em> or <em>G3</em>, in physics to <em>AIP Advances</em> or <em>Scientific Reports</em>, and so forth. Publishers will have to compete in order to attract authors, either on price or publisher services or both. They'll have to market these journals to authors, using their intellectual capital to convince authors that OA journals (at least <em>their</em> OA journals) are a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Good_Thing">Good Thing</a>. As authors and promotion committees get used to using the new article-level metrics (as they already increasingly are, with download counts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">h-index</a>), journal brand name — whether of these mega-journals or traditional journals — will become less important, and authors will feel freer to publish in these and other OA journals, again based on publisher services rather than journal brand name.</p>
<p>As an aside, I note that PLoS has another nascent service, <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/faq.php#ploshubs">PLoS Hubs</a>, that could interact synergistically with the mega-journal trend as well. Hubs provide the ability to build subcollections of articles from <em>PLoS ONE</em> or other journals based on various selection criteria. At the moment, the hubs are specified and curated by PLoS editors, but you could imagine opening up the service to hubs based on whatever selection criteria a self-proclaimed editor chooses. For instance, I could put together a subcollection of articles in my own field, computational linguistics, essentially generating a bespoke computational linguistics journal of articles already vetted for validity by PLoS reviewers, and for field by me, and perhaps by predicted impact by a cohort of post-reviewers I assemble. It provides a platform for the kind of ecology of overlay journals that has been talked about for many years, but with little in the way of success. (<a href="http://f1000.com/">Faculty of 1000</a> is a notable case for the life sciences, but hasn't been replicated elsewhere.) The ability to have their articles participate in such hubs would provide mega-journal authors with the ability to generate cachet from imprimatur without the access limitations of traditional field-focused journals.</p>
<p>Mega-journals could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_New_Thing">the new new thing</a> that makes open-access publishing viable at scope. If so, <a href="http://www.plos.org">Public Library of Science</a> would have cracked it — not through its flagship but self-consciously retro journals but through its unlikely innovation <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p>
