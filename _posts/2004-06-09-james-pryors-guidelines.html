<p>
I've just discoveredÂ <a href="http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html">James Pryor's "Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper"</a>. Despite the ostensible limited goal of the guidelines, they are much more broadly applicable than just to philosophy papers. I especially like the characterization of readers as "lazy, stupid, and mean".
