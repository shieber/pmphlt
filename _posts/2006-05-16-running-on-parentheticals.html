<p>
A common source of run-on sentences is the inclusion of a parenthetical full sentence at the end of another sentence, for instance,
<blockquote>This is an example (there may be others).</blockquote>
This construction is always wrong. Separate the two sentences, as
<blockquote>This is an example. (There may be others.)</blockquote>
or coordinate or subordinate the two, as
<blockquote>This is an example (though there may be others).</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>This is an example (and there may be others).</blockquote>
The following is not correct:
<blockquote>This is an example (however, there may be others).</blockquote>
<a title="Running on howevers" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/groundtruth/2004/05/25/4/">“However” is an adverb</a>, not a subordinating conjunction.
