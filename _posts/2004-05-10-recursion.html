<p>
To <em><a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=recurse">recurse</a></em> is to curse again, not an activity that an academic, or an algorithm for that matter, should engage in. When a process is repeated or is subject to recursion, it is said to <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=recur"><em>recur</em></a>.
