<p>I'll be visiting Tromsø, Norway to attend the <a href="http://site.uit.no/muninconf/">Tenth Annual Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing</a>, which is being held November 30 to December 1. I'm looking forward to the talks, including keynotes from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/how-journals-nature-science-cell-damage-science">Randy Schekman</a> and <a href="http://www.nordita.org/people/index.php?variant=single&amp;u=sabineh">Sabine Hossenfelder</a> and an interview by <a href="https://no.linkedin.com/in/caroline-sutton-90a0941">Caroline Sutton</a> of my colleague <a href="http://bit.ly/petersuber">Peter Suber</a>, director of Harvard's <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/">Office for Scholarly Communication</a>. My own keynote will be on "The role of higher education institutions in scholarly publishing and communication". Here's the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Institutions of higher education are in a double bind with respect to scholarly communication: On the one hand, they need to support the research needs of their students and researchers by providing access to the journals that comprise the archival record of scholarship. Doing so requires payment of substantial subscription fees. On the other hand, they need to provide the widest possible dissemination of works by those same researchers -- the fruits of that very research -- which itself incurs costs. I address how these two goals, each of which demands outlays of substantial funds, can best be honored. In the course of the discussion, I provide a first look at some new results on predicting journal usage, which allows for optimizing subscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The video of my talk at the Munin conference is <a href="https://mediasite.uit.no/Mediasite/Play/a7c4bbe89b1d46d187fe3baa99229bec1d">now available</a>.
