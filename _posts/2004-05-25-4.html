<p>
People seem to fall prey to adverbials like "however" and "rather" seducing them into running on sentences.
<blockquote>This type of approach has been used in previous models, however, the presented algorithm adopts a different foundation.</blockquote>
But these words are not conjunctions, subordinating or otherwise. They are adverbs, like "on the other hand" or "unfortunately". The following is, presumably, clearly infelicitous.
<blockquote>This type of approach has been used in previous models, unfortunately, the presented algorithm adopts a different foundation.</blockquote>
By the same token, so is the sentence with "however". It is easily corrected:
<blockquote>This type of approach has been used in previous models; however, the presented algorithm adopts a different foundation.</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>This type of approach has been used in previous models. The presented algorithm, however, adopts a different foundation.</blockquote>
