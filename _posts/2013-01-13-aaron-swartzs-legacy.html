<p>Government zealotry in prosecuting brilliant people is a repeating theme. It gave rise to <a href="http://bit.ly/VZSPnH">one of the great intellectual tragedies of the 20th century, the death of Alan Turing after his appalling treatment by the British government</a>. Sadly, we have just been presented with another case. Aaron Swartz <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">committed suicide at his apartment in New York this week</a> in the face of an <a href="http://unhandled.com/2013/01/12/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/">overreaching prosecution</a> of his JSTOR download action. I never met him, but I understand <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">from those who knew him well</a> that he was a brilliant, committed person who only acted intending to do good in the world. I'm on the record disagreeing with the particulars of the open access tactic for which he was being prosecuted, <a href="http://bit.ly/n9Wssm">on the basis that it was counterproductive</a>. But I empathize with the gut instinct that led to his effort. I hope that it will inspire us all to redouble our efforts to eliminate the needless restraints on the distribution and use of scholarship as Swartz himself was trying to achieve.</p>
