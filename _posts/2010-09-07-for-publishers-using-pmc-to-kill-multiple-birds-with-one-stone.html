<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2010/09/pmclogo.gif" alt="PubMed Central logo" width="145" height="75" align="right"></a>Here's a clever way for a journal to efficiently and cost-effectively provide open access to its articles (at least in the life sciences): Use <a class="zem_slink" title="PubMed Central" rel="homepage" href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a> as the journal's article repository. This expedient has all kinds of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">You have to allow for PMC distribution anyway</a>, in fields where much of the research is <a class="zem_slink" title="National Institutes of Health" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=39.000443,-77.102394&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=39.000443,-77.102394%20(National%20Institutes%20of%20Health)&amp;t=h">NIH</a> funded. Might as well make that version the version of record.</li>
<li>PMC provides articles in multiple formats (XML, HTML, and PDF), and handles the format conversion for you.</li>
<li>PMC provides pages for each issue as well as structured index pages for the full run.</li>
<li>PMC's user interface provides all kinds of added value for readers, like inline citation cross-linking, links to related articles and related citations, and other articles by the same authors. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884311/">Here's</a> an example.)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> has exceptional <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/26/AR2006042602441.html">Google juice</a>, so articles will appear high on Google and Google Scholar listings.</li>
<li>Your authors don't have to deal with the PMC process in addition to the publisher's process, since they are one and the same.</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about the headaches of running your own repository (though you may want to have branded pages linking to these articles that are more attractive than <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/540/">those provided by PMC</a>).</li>
<li>It's not likely that PMC is going to disappear any time soon, so you've got some built in access longevity.</li>
<li>It's <em>free</em> to the publisher. PMC doesn't charge for storing and distributing articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>I first heard about this idea a while ago at a PMC meeting in a discussion referring toÂ <em><a href="http://jbt.abrf.org/">Journal of Biomolecular Techniques</a></em>, which uses this approach. It seemed like an awfully good idea to me, and still does. <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process_journals.htm">Almost a thousand journals</a> submit all of their final published articles to PMC, but I'm not sure how many do so without embargo and as the sole and definitive version of record.</p>
