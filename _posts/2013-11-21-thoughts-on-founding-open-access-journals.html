<p>Precipitated by a recent request to review some proposals for new open-access journals, I spent some time gathering my own admittedly idiosyncratic thoughts on some of the issues that should be considered when founding new open-access journals. I make them available here. Good sources for more comprehensive information on launching and operating open-access journals are SPARC’s <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/publishing/journal-publishing-RI">open-access journal publishing resource index</a> and the Open Access Directories <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Guides_for_OA_journal_publishers">guides for OA journal publishers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/policies/">Unlike most of my posts</a>, I may augment this post over time, and will do so without explicit marking of the changes. Your thoughts on additions to the topics below—via comments or <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/contact.html">email</a>—are appreciated. A version number (currently version 1.0) will track the changes for reference.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="it-is-better-to-flip-a-journal-than-to-found-one">It is better to flip a journal than to found one</h3>
<p>The world has <a href="http://pages.cmns.sfu.ca/heather-morrison/appendix-c-how-many-active-scholarly-peer-reviewed-journals/">enough journals</a>. Adding new open-access journals as alternatives to existing ones may be useful if there are significant numbers of high quality articles being generated in a field for which there is no reasonable open-access venue for publication. Such cases are quite rare, especially given the rise of <a href="http://bit.ly/hTyW99">open-access “megajournals”</a> covering the sciences (<em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/">PLoS ONE</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificreports">Scientific Reports</a></em>, <em><a href="http://aipadvances.aip.org/">AIP Advances</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.springerplus.com/">SpringerPlus</a></em>, etc.), and the social sciences and humanities (<em><a href="http://sgo.sagepub.com/">SAGE Open</a></em>). Where there are already adequate open-access venues (even if no one journal is “perfect” for the field), scarce resources are probably better spent elsewhere, especially on <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Journals_that_converted_from_TA_to_OA">flipping journals from closed to open access</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the world does not have enough open-access journals (at least high-quality ones). So if it is not possible to flip a journal, founding a new one may be a reasonable fallback position, but it is definitely the inferior alternative.</p>
<h3 id="licensing-should-be-by-cc-by">Licensing should be by CC-BY</h3>
<p>As long as you’re founding a new journal, its contents should be as open as possible consistent with appropriate attribution. That exactly characterizes <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">the CC-BY license</a>. It’s also a tremendously simple approach. Once the author grants a CC-BY license, no further rights need be granted to the publisher. There’s no need for talk about granting the publisher a nonexclusive license to publish the article, etc., etc. The CC-BY license already allows the publisher to do so. There’s no need to talk about what rights the author retains, since the author retains all rights subject to the nonexclusive CC-BY license. I’ve made <a href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:10121960">the case for a CC-BY license</a> at length elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="its-all-about-the-editorial-board">It’s all about the editorial board</h3>
<p>The main product that a journal is selling is its reputation. A new journal with no track record needs high quality submissions to bootstrap that reputation, and at the start, nothing is more convincing to authors to submit high quality work to the journal than its editorial board. Getting high-profile names somewhere on the masthead at the time of the official launch is the most important thing for the journal to do. (“We can add more people later” is a risky proposition. You may not get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w_bd0Ii_WY">a second chance to make a first impression</a>.)</p>
<p>Getting high-profile names on your board may occur naturally if you use the expedient of flipping an existing closed-access journal, thereby stealing the board, which also has the benefit of acquiring the journal’s previous reputation and eliminating one more subscription journal.</p>
<p>Another good idea for jumpstarting a journal’s reputation is to prime the article pipeline by inviting leaders in the field to submit their best articles to the journal before its official launch, so that the journal announcement can provide information on forthcoming articles by luminaries.</p>
<h3 id="follow-ethical-standards">Follow ethical standards</h3>
<p>Adherence to the codes of conduct of the <a href="http://oaspa.org/membership/membership-benefits/">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association</a> (OASPA) and the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/join-cope">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> (COPE) should be fundamental. Membership in the organizations is recommended; the fees are extremely reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-outsource-the-process">You can outsource the process</h3>
<p>There is a lot of interest among certain institutions to found new open-access journals, institutions that may have no particular special expertise in operating journals. A good solution is to outsource the operation of the journal to an organization that does have special expertise, namely, a journal publisher. There are several such publishers who have experience running open-access journals effectively and efficiently. Some are exclusively open-access publishers, for example, Co-Action Publishing, Hindawi Publishing, Ubiquity Press. Others handle both open- and closed-access journals: HighWire Press, Oxford University Press, ScholasticaHQ, Springer/BioMed Central, Wiley. This is not intended as a complete listing (the Open Access Directory has <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_journal_launch_services">a complementary offering</a>), nor in any sense an endorsement of any of these organizations, just a comment that shopping the journal around to a publishing partner may be a good idea. Especially given the economies of scale that exist in journal publishing, an open-access publishing partner may allow the journal to operate much more economically than having to establish a whole organization in-house.</p>
<h3 id="certain-functionality-should-be-considered-a-baseline">Certain functionality should be considered a baseline</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/">Geoffrey Pullum</a>, in his immensely satisfying essays “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4047489">Stalking the Perfect Journal</a>” and “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4047585">Seven Deadly Sins in Journal Publishing</a>”, lists his personal criteria in journal design. They are a good starting point, but need updating for the era of online distribution. (There is altogether too much concern with the contents of the journal’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spine_(bookbinding)###Spine_titling">spine text</a> for instance.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing should be <strong>anonymous</strong> (with regard to the reviewers) and <strong>blind</strong> (with regard to the authors), except where a commanding argument can be given for experimenting with alternatives.</li>
<li>Every article should be <strong>preserved</strong> in one (or better, more than one) preservation system. <a href="http://www.clockss.org/">CLOCKSS</a>, <a href="http://www.portico.org/">Portico</a><sup><a id="fnref1" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, a university or institutional archival digital repository are good options.</li>
<li>Every article should have complete <strong>bibliographic metadata</strong> on the first page, including license information (a simple reference to CC-BY; see above), and (as per Pullum) first and last page numbers.</li>
<li>The journal should provide <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOIs</a></strong> for its articles. OASPA membership is an inexpensive way to acquire the ability to assign DOIs. An article’s DOI should be included in the bibliographic metadata on the first page.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s additional functionality beyond this baseline that would be ideal, though the tradeoff against the additional effort required would have to be evaluated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <strong>article-level metrics</strong>, especially download statistics, though other “<a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a>” may be helpful.</li>
<li>Provide access to the articles in <strong>multiple formats</strong> in addition to PDF: HTML, XML with the NLM DTD.</li>
<li>Provide the option for readers to receive <strong>alerts</strong> of new content through emails and RSS feeds.</li>
<li>Encourage authors to provide the underlying <strong>data</strong> to be distributed openly as well, and provide the infrastructure for them to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="take-advantage-of-the-networked-digital-era">Take advantage of the networked digital era</h3>
<p>Many journal publishing conventions of long standing are no longer well motivated in the modern era. Here are a few examples. They are not meant to be exhaustive. You can probably think of others. The point is that certain standard ideas can and should be rethought.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no longer any need for “<strong>issues</strong>” of journals. Each article should be published as soon as it is finished, no later and no sooner. If you’d like, an “issue” number can be assigned that is incremented for each article. (Volumes, incremented annually, are still necessary because many aspects of the scholarly publishing and library infrastructure make use of them. They are also useful for the purpose of characterizing a bolus of content for storage and preservation purposes.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Endnotes</strong>, a relic of the day when typesetting was a complicated and fraught process that was eased by a human being not having to determine how much space to leave at the bottom of a page for footnotes, should be permanently retired. Footnotes are far easier for readers (which is the whole point really), and computers do the drudgery of calculating the space for them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Page limits</strong> are silly. In the old physical journal days, page limits had two purposes. They were necessary because journal issues came in quanta of page signatures, and therefore had fundamental physical limits to the number of pages that could be included. A network-distributed journal no longer has this problem. Page limits also serve the purpose of constraining the author to write relatively succinctly, easing the burden on reviewer and (eventually) reader. But for this purpose the page is not a robust unit of measurement of the constrained resource, the reviewers’ and the readers’ attention. One page can hold anything from a few hundred to a thousand or more words. If limits are to be required, they should be stated in appropriate units such as the number of words. The word count should not include figures, tables, or bibliography, as they impinge on readers’ attention in a qualitatively different way.</li>
<li>Author-date <strong>citation</strong> is far superior to numeric citation in every way except for the amount of space and ink required. Now that digital documents use no physical space or ink, there is no longer an excuse for numeric citations. Similarly, <em>ibid.</em> and <em>op. cit.</em> should be permanently retired. I appreciate that different fields have different conventions on these matters. That doesn’t change the fact that those fields that have settled on numeric citations or ibidded footnotes are on the wrong side of technological history.</li>
<li>Extensive worry about and investment in fancy <strong>navigation</strong> within and among the journal’s articles is likely to be a waste of time, effort, and resources. To first approximation, all accesses to articles in the journal will come from sites higher up in the web food chain—the <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google’s</a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing’s</a>, the <a href="http://www.base-search.net/about/en/">BASE’s</a> and <a href="http://www.oclc.org/oaister.en.html?urlm=168646">OAIster’s</a> of the world. Functionality that simplifies navigation among articles across the whole scholarly literature (cross-linked DOIs in bibliographies, for instance, or linked open metadata of various sorts) is a different matter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="think-twice">Think twice</h3>
<p>In the end, think long and hard about whether founding a new open-access journal is the best use of your time and your institution’s resources in furthering the goals of open scholarly communication. Operating a journal is not free, in cash and in time. Perhaps a better use of resources is making sure that <a href="http://oacompact.org">the academic institutions</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/sLhk3H">funders</a> are set up to underwrite the existing open-access journals in the optimal way. But if it's the right thing to do, do it right.</p>
