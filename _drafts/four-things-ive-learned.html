<p>Four things that I’ve learned in some three decades as a student and professor at Harvard University:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot of people at Harvard who are, like, really smart.</li>
<li>Not everyone at Harvard is, like, really smart.</li>
<li>The smart ones never say things like “I’m, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949618475877765120">like, really smart</a>.”</li>
<li>Instead, it becomes known by virtue of their saying things that are, actually, really smart.</li>
</ol>
