<p>I’ve written in the past about the fairness algorithm “cut and choose” (in particular in the context of <a href="http://bit.ly/192vlHk">solving the gerrymandering problem</a>). Just today, I tripped over an especially early example of its use, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+18%3A22-24&amp;version=NIV">1 Kings 18:22–24</a>. The prophet Elijah, proponent of Adonai, proposes a contest with the 450 prophets of the god Ba‘al: Whose god can deliver a miracle of the self-lighting burnt offering. They’ll both prepare a burnt offering, but without providing a fire. Whoever’s offering burns, their god wins. But to be fair, Elijah let’s the prophets of Ba‘al pick which of the two bulls they want to use; that way, there can’t be a rigged bull. After much unsportsmanlike taunting of Ba‘al’s prophets by Elijah, and not surprisingly (it’s the Hebrew bible after all), Elijah’s burnt offering is struck by heavenly fire.</p>
<p>Stuff like that apparently used to happen.</p>
