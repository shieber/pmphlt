<p>This blog presents occasional writings by <a
href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/">Stuart Shieber</a>,
professor of computer science in the <a
href="http://seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences</a> in the <a href="http://fas.harvard.edu/">Faculty of Arts
and Sciences</a> at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard
University</a>, and director of the university's <a
href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/">Office for Scholarly
Communications</a>. Topics center around whatever he is interested in
at the moment, which currently includes topics such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>scholarly communications and open access and other academic matters</li>
<li>computer science</li>
<li>language, linguistics, and computational linguistics</li>

<div class="groundtruth-info"> <p>As of July 18, 2025, I've integrated
into this blog the posts from my previous blog "The Ground Truth" (now
archived <a
href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/groundtruth/">here</a>), a
venue in which I ranted about technicalities in writing and
editing. That blog was mostly intended for capturing standard issues I
kept commenting to students about; it allowed me to just forward a
link rather than rehashing a peeve I'd hashed repeatedly before. You
may note a different air about such posts.</p>

<p>Those posts are marked with the
tag "<a href="/tags/groundtruth/">groundtruth</a>" and modified styling.</p>
