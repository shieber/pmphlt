  content: "WHAT'S IN A WORD: TO \"LEGISLATE\" AND/OR TO \"LEGITIMIZE\": THE DOUBLE=MEANING\
    \ OF \"MANDATE\"\n\nAlthough there is a hint of the hermeneutic in his [reflections](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2009/06/30/university-open-access-policies-as-mandates/)\
    \ on the uses of the word \"mandate,\" I think Stuart Shieber, the architect of\
    \ [Harvard's historic Open Access (OA) policy](http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=Harvard%20University%3A%20Faculty%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences)\
    \ is quite right in spirit. The word \"mandate\" is only useful to the extent\
    \ that it helps get a deposit policy officially adopted -- and one that most faculty\
    \ will actually comply with.\n\nFirst, note that it has never been suggested that\
    \ there need to be penalties for noncompliance. OA, after all, is based solely\
    \ on [benefits](http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html) to the researcher;\
    \ the idea is not to coerce researchers into doing something that is not in their\
    \ interest, or something they would really prefer not to do.\n\nIndeed, the [author\
    \ surveys](http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11006/) and [outcome studies](http://fcms.its.utas.edu.au/scieng/comp/project.asp?lProjectId=1830)\
    \ that I have so often cited provide evidence that -- far from being opposed to\
    \ deposit mandates -- authors welcome them, and comply with them, over 80% of\
    \ them willingly.\n\nIt is hence natural to ask: if researchers welcome and willingly\
    \ comply with deposit mandates, *why don't they deposit without a mandate?*\n\n\
    I think this is a fundamental question; that it has an answer; and that its answer\
    \ is very revealing and especially relevant here, because it is related to the\
    \ double meaning of \"mandate\", which means both to \"legislate\" and to \"legitimize\"\
    : \n\nThere are many worries ([at least 34](http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/self-faq/#32-worries)\
    \ of them, all groundless and easily answered) keeping most authors from self-archiving\
    \ on their own, unmandated. But the principle three are worries (1) that self-archiving\
    \ is illegal, (2) that self-archiving may put acceptance for publication by their\
    \ preferred journals at risk and (3) that self-archiving is a time-consuming,\
    \ low-priority task for already overloaded academics.\n\nFormal institutional\
    \ mandates to self-archive [alleviate](http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/12094/)\
    \ worries (1) - (3) (and the 31 lesser worries as well) by making it clear to\
    \ all that self-archiving is now an official institutional policy of high priority.\n\
    \nHarvard's mandate alleviates the three worries (although not, in my opinion,\
    \ in the [optimal](http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/494-guid.html)\
    \ way) by (1) mandating rights-retention, but (2) allowing a waiver or opt-out\
    \ if the author has any reason not to comply. This covers legal worries about\
    \ copyright and practical worries about publisher prejudice. The ergonomic worry\
    \ is mooted by (3) having a proxy service (from the provost's office, not the\
    \ dean's!) do the deposit on the author's behalf.\n\nThe reason I say the Harvard\
    \ mandate is not optimal is that -- as Stuart notes -- the crucial condition for\
    \ the success and universality of OA self-archiving mandates is *to ensure that\
    \ the deposit itself gets done, under all conditions*, even if the author opts\
    \ out because of worries about legality or publisher prejudice. \n\nThis distinction\
    \ is clearly made in the [FAQ](http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/545-guid.html)\
    \ accompanying the Harvard mandate, informing authors that they should deposit\
    \ their final refereed drafts upon acceptance for publication *whether or not\
    \ they opt out of making access to their deposits immediately OA*.\n\nHarvard's\
    \ mandate itself (not just the accompanying FAQ) should have required immediate\
    \ deposit, and [the opt-out clause should only have pertained to whether or not\
    \ access to that deposit is immediately made OA](http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/364-guid.html).\
    \ The reason is that [Closed Access](http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/274-guid.html)\
    \ deposit moots both the worry about legality and the worry about journal prejudice.\
    \ It is merely an institution-internal record-keeping matter, not an OA or publication\
    \ issue.\n\nBut even though the Harvard mandate is suboptimal in this regard,\
    \ this probably does not matter greatly, because the combination of Harvard's\
    \ official mandate and Harvard's accompanying FAQ have almost the same effect\
    \ as including the deposit requirement in the official mandate would have had.\
    \ The mandate is in any case noncoercive. There are no penalties for noncompliance.\
    \ It merely provides Harvard's official institutional sanction for self-archiving\
    \ and it officially enjoins all faculty to do so. (Note that both \"injunction\"\
    \ and \"sanction\" likewise have the double-meaning of \"mandate\": each can mean\
    \ either officially legislating something or officially legitimizing something,\
    \ or both.)\n\nNow to something closer to ordinary English: There is definitely\
    \ a difference between an official *request* and an official *requirement*; and\
    \ the [total failure](http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/nih/2007housecalltoaction.html)\
    \ of the first version of the NIH policy (merely a request) -- as well as the\
    \ failure of the current request-policies of most of the planet's current institutional\
    \ repositories -- has shown that only an official requirement can successfully\
    \ generate deposits and fill repositories -- as the [ subsequent NIH policy upgrade\
    \ to a mandate](http://www.libraryjournal.com/info/CA6581624.html#news1) and the\
    \ [90 other institutional and funder mandates](http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/)\
    \ worldwide are demonstrating.\n\nSo whereas the word \"mandate\" (or \"requirement\"\
    ) may sometimes be a handicap at the stage where an institution is still debating\
    \ about whether or not to adopt a deposit policy at all, it is definitely an advantage,\
    \ indeed a necessity, if the policy, once adopted, is to succeed in generating\
    \ compliance: Requirements work, requests don't.\n\nAll experience to date has\
    \ also shown that whereas adding various positive incentives ([rewards](http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A2=ind06&L=american-scientist-open-access-forum&F=l&P=13736)\
    \ for first depositors, \"[cream of science](http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/waaijers/)\"\
    \ showcasing, librarian assistance and [proxy-depositing](http://www.eprints.org/documentation/handbook/libraries.php))\
    \ to a mandate can help accelerate compliance, no penalties for noncompliance\
    \ are needed. Mandates work if they are officially requirements and not requests,\
    \ if compliance monitoring and implementation procedures are in place, and if\
    \ the researcher population is well informed of both the mandate requirements\
    \ and the benefits of OA.\n\nHaving said all that, I would like to close by pointing\
    \ out one sanction/incentive (depending on how you look at it) that is already\
    \ implicitly built into the academic reward system: Is \"publish-or-perish\" a\
    \ mandate, or merely an admonition?\n\nAcademics are not \"required\" to publish,\
    \ but they are well-advised to do so, for success in getting a job, a grant, or\
    \ a promotion. Nor are publications merely counted any more, in performance review,\
    \ like beans. Their research impact is taken into account too. And it is precisely\
    \ research impact that [OA enhances](http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html).\
    \ \n\nSo making one's research output OA is already connected causally to the\
    \ existing \"publish-or-perish\" reward system of academia, whether or not OA\
    \ is mandated. An OA mandate simply closes the causal loop and makes the causal\
    \ connection explicit. Indeed, a number of the mandating institutions have [procedurally\
    \ linked](http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/502-guid.html) their\
    \ deposit mandates to their performance review system:\n\nFaculty already have\
    \ to submit their refereed publication lists for performance review today. Several\
    \ of the universities that mandate deposit have simply indicated that *henceforth\
    \ the official mode of submission of publications for performance review will\
    \ be via deposit in the Institutional Repository*. \n\nThis simple, natural procedural\
    \ update -- not unlike the transition from submitting paper CVs to submitting\
    \ digital CVs -- is at the same time all the sanction/incentive that academics\
    \ need: To borrow the title of Steve Lawrence's seminal [2001 Nature paper](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/)\
    \ on the OA impact advantage: \"*Online or Invisible*.\" \n\nHence an OA \"mandate\"\
    \ is in essence just another bureaucratic requirement to do [a few extra keystrokes\
    \ per paper](http://blogsearch.google.ca/blogsearch?hl=en&num=100&c2coff=1&safe=active&ie=UTF-8&q=%22keystroke+mandate%22+blogurl:http://openaccess.eprints.org/&filter=0&sa=N),\
    \ to deposit a digital copy in one's institution's IR. This amounts to no more\
    \ than a [trivial extension](http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/10688/) to  the existing\
    \ mandate to do the keystrokes to write and publish the paper in the first place:[\
    \ Publisher or Perish, Deposit to Flourish](http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw64/harnad.html).\n\
