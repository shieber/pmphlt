  content: 'There are in fact arguments that one should use the notation "(x)f" instead
    of "f(x)". This proposal harmonizes the reading direction (from left to right)
    with the data flow: The input "x" is given to "f" which produces an output.


    This is especially useful when composing functions. A complex function "h" might
    be the composite of simpler functions "f" and "g": "h(x) = g(f(x))". This means
    that "x" is first given to "f", which produces an intermediate value, which is
    then given to "g". Notice that the flow of data doesn''t match the reading direction.
    In the alternate proposal, the equation would read "(x)h = ((x)f)g".


    In several branches of mathematics, so called "commutative diagrams" are an important
    visualization aid. Reversing the traditional notation would help with translating
    those diagrams to formulas and back.'

    "everyone in the US", you mean.'
