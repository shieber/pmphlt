  content: "IS HARVARD'S NO-OPT-OUT DEPOSIT-REQUIREMENT CLEAR ENOUGH?\n\nStuart Shieber's\
    \ reply to Matt Welsh's worries about the Harvard Open Access policy is spot-on\
    \ in every respect.\n\nNo one could be a more fervent well-wisher for the success\
    \ of the Harvard OA policy than I am. But the crucial criterion for the success\
    \ of an OA policy is how much OA it actually generates. \n\nIt is splendid that\
    \ 95% of Harvard authors have not opted out of the copyright reservation clause.\
    \ But what percentage have been complying with the no-opt-out deposit clause by\
    \ actually depositing or providing a deposit-copy of their articles? \n\nStuart\
    \ is certainly right that it is hard to imagine that providing the articles is\
    \ \"a huge pain.\" But is it clear to Harvard authors that they have to do it?\
    \ \n\nHere are the relevant portions of the the FAS OA Policy:\n\n-- I. COPYRIGHT\
    \ RESERVATION CLAUSE: \"Each Faculty member grants to the President and Fellows\
    \ of Harvard College permission to make available his or her scholarly articles\
    \ and to exercise the copyright in those articles….The Dean or the Dean’s designate\
    \ will waive application of the policy for a particular article upon written request\
    \ by a Faculty member explaining the need.\"\n\n-- II. DEPOSIT CLAUSE: \"To assist\
    \ the University in distributing the articles, each Faculty member will provide\
    \ an electronic copy of the final version of the article at no charge to the appropriate\
    \ representative of the Provost’s Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF)\
    \ specified by the Provost’s Office.\"\n\nIs it clear to Harvard authors that\
    \ a formal opt-out from Clause I is not an opt-out from Clause II (i.e., that\
    \ deposit must be done in any case)? \n\nThe answer to this question would be\
    \ implicit in the annual percentage of Harvard's refereed research output that\
    \ is actually being deposited or provided for deposit. If that percentage does\
    \ not approach or match the 95% non-opt-out rate for Clause I, then perhaps the\
    \ contingencies need to be made a lot clearer.\n\nHere's are four suggestions:\
    \ \n\n1. Place the Deposit Clause first, and state explicitly that there is no\
    \ opt-out or waiver from this deposit requirement, only from the copyright-reservation\
    \ clause that follows. All articles must be deposited in DASH. Access to those\
    \ for which the Copyright Reservation Clause has been waived will be set as Closed\
    \ Access instead of Open Access. (And, to prevent the deposit requirement from\
    \ being a vague, open-ended one that can be left to be complied with in 2022,\
    \ state explicitly that the deposit must be done immediately upon acceptance for\
    \ publication.)\n\nThis clarification is all the more important, since universities\
    \ are beginning follow Harvard's example by adopting the Harvard model as their\
    \ OA policy: This makes it all the more crucial to make sure that the policy model\
    \ is clear, understood, and actually works.\n\nHere are two further suggestions,\
    \ that have both already been demonstrated to make an immediate-deposit (ID/OA)\
    \ requirement more attractive and better complied with:\n\n2. Designate deposit\
    \ in DASH as henceforth the sole mechanism for submitting refereed research for\
    \ performance review (the \"Liège Model\") bit.ly/OAmodelLiege\n\n3. Implement\
    \ the automatized \"email eprint request\" Button in DASH, to allow individual\
    \ users, via one click, to request a single copy of a Closed Access deposit for\
    \ research purposes; the author can then likewise, via one click, fulfill or decline\
    \ each individual request. This will help tide over research needs for embargoed\
    \ deposits.\n\n4. Provide download and citation statistics like IRstats to demonstrate\
    \ for authors the benefits of depositing their articles."
