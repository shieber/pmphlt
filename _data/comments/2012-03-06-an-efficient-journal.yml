  content: "@Kent Anderson —\n\n*1. How much did Microtome Publishing make in revenues\
    \ in 2011? *\n\nNot very much, but enough to cover all its expenses and my time.\
    \ Surely you're not insinuating that I'm gouging the customers at $.08 per page.\
    \ Do you know of any other journal that has *decreased* its print prices by a\
    \ factor of three over the last eight years? And remember, JMLR is an open-access\
    \ journal; no one needs to pay a penny to read their articles.\n\n*What was it’s\
    \ margin on these revenues? Who kept this money? Where did it go?*\n\nI kept the\
    \ money. It went into my pocket, as sole proprietor.\n\n*2. Do the people you’re\
    \ raising money from, a) get a tax deduction and b) know that there’s a printing\
    \ subsidiary run by you on the side?*\n\nThere's a bit of a misconception in your\
    \ question. Microtome is not a \"subsidiary\" of JMLR, Inc. The two are completely\
    \ separate entities. In fact, Microtome was founded well before it took over *JMLR*'s\
    \ print version.\n\n(a) As a sole proprietorship Microtome hasn't raised any money\
    \ from anyone. You'd have to contact JMLR, Inc. to determine if their donors took\
    \ a tax deduction, but I'd assume so. \n\n(b) The relationship between *JMLR*\
    \ and Microtome is made explicit on [the front page of the *JMLR* web site](http://jmlr.org/):\
    \ \n\nFinal versions are published electronically (ISSN 1533-7928) immediately\
    \ upon receipt. Until the end of 2004, paper volumes (ISSN 1532-4435) were published\
    \ 8 times annually and sold to libraries and individuals by the MIT Press. Paper\
    \ volumes (ISSN 1532-4435) are now published and sold by Microtome Publishing.\
    \ \n\nMy involvement with Microtome is made clear on [the Microtome web site](http://mtome.com/founder.htm)\
    \ that [JMLR links to](http://mtome.com/).\n\n*3. How do UCSD, Southern Louisiana,\
    \ and the University of Minnesota cover the costs of their people serving in roles\
    \ on this journal? Are there contracts? Or is it all voluntary?*\n\nYou'd have\
    \ to ask them, but my guess is that they cover these people serving in these roles\
    \ just as they and other universities cover so many of us as reviewers and editorial\
    \ board members for so many journals published by commercial or non-profit publishers\
    \ — as unpaid volunteers. As you know, volunteering to review articles for journals\
    \ and serve on editorial boards and in other editorial positions is something\
    \ faculty do without pay, without contracts, without compensation of any sort,\
    \ as part of our perceived duty to the scholarly endeavor. I'm not sure why you\
    \ find it so hard to believe that all these people are volunteers but they really\
    \ are.\n\n*4. How do you explain that your organization’s tax-exempt status was\
    \ revoked because you apparently neglected to file the proper (aka, “annoying”)\
    \ paperwork?*\n\nMy organization, Microtome Publishing, is and has always been\
    \ a sole proprietorship, not a non-profit organization. \n\nJMLR, Inc. is a non-profit.\
    \ I wasn't aware that JMLR, Inc. had lost its nonprofit status until you pointed\
    \ it out. You'd have to contact them to find out the details, but I understand\
    \ from Professor Kaelbling that they were late filing their annual report.\n\n\

    editor, program committee member, conference area chair, major conference program
    co-chair for over 30 years. For commercial and nonprofit venues in several areas
    of computer science and artificial intelligence. During that time, I have been
    employed by universities, a non-profit research institute, and companies. All
    of those employers not just accepted my doing that work, they encouraged it as
    a service to the scientific community. The most consideration I ever got for editorial
    work from a commercial journal was a free subscription for the duration of my
    role.  For over 10 years, I have refused to do any such work for venues that are
    not open access. If my employers and me (on my evenings, weekends, and sometimes
    vacations) are supporting this service, the least I can ask is that the results
    of our volunteer effort be available to all without discrimination.

  content: 'Kent,


    Let''s try this one more time. JMLR, Inc. is a separate company from the two companies
    (MIT Press and Microtome Publishing) that have performed its print publishing
    service. So JMLR, Inc. is not "personally profiting from the non-profit’s output
    (which is illegal, by the way)". Microtome Publishing is charging for print editions
    of the journal, as every other commercial (and non-profit) publisher does. Doing
    so is completely consistent with open-access principles (BOAI calls for "free
    and unrestricted *online* availability"), non-profit status (applicable to MIT
    Press but not Microtome in any case), transparency (since the arrangement is disclosed
    at the JMLR website), and law.


    I understand how the many people listed in official roles — editors, editorial
    board, advisory board — are accomplishing their work. They do so just like their
    counterparts at any other journal do. They volunteer their time. You seem to think
    donations to a journal constitute a "bailout". Some of us academics might think
    of the total donated labor contributed to the academic journals of the world a
    bit of a bailout too. The donations to JMLR, $3,500 total over 12 years, don''t
    come close to the value of the donated labor to it and to every other academic
    journal. If we academics stopped "bailing out" the journals of the world (as you
    would have it), the whole system would collapse.


    I don''t understand your concern about returning money to JMLR. The arrangement
    that Microtome made with JMLR is identical to that of MIT Press before it. Do
    you complain of MIT Press that it "raises money to cover its costs"? How else
    would one cover one''s costs except by raising money? The only thing notable about
    Microtome is how low we''ve been able to keep those costs. If JMLR wanted to take
    over the print edition and keep the revenue, they could have done so at any time,
    and can still. As for the $7,000 per year that you hallucinated I pay myself for
    my time, where did *that* come from?


    Finally, and most upsetting, is the unconcealed condescension in your last paragraph
    ("nice there''s a little journal...floating papers...running a posting platform").
    JMLR ranks in the 93rd percentile for Impact Factor in its subject area; the Journal
    of Bone and Joint Surgery ranks in the 90th percentile in its. JMLR is publishing
    about 3,500 pages per year of scholarly articles, somewhat more than JBJS. Your
    patronizing attitude toward the work of the many people who make JMLR a leading
    journal is not, I hope, typical of the view of academic publishers. And I hope
    it''s not your view of the volunteers who contribute to JBJS''s success too.'

  content: 'I can''t examine your not-for-profit filings, because your journal isn''t
    efficient enough to maintain its basic status in the world. Your non-profit status
    was apparently revoked because you didn''t file the required paperwork for THREE
    CONSECUTIVE YEARS. Contemplate that in the light of a claim of efficiency. Part
    of efficiency is management efficiency, not just doing things cheaply. Cutting
    corners so severely that you lose your non-profit status isn''t efficiency --
    it''s sloppiness, as your colleague indicates.


    It seems like you''ve been filing for non-profit status without being serious
    about it. That''s cynical. You should take the status of a charity in the Commonwealth
    of Massachusetts seriously.


    My question about where the money is going centers around what appears to be private
    (aka, personal) benefit from the activities of a non-profit. I can''t tell if
    you''re listed as a trustee or as another key figure on your non-profit filings
    (because your status has been revoked), but if you are, you might be in trouble.
    And the $7K figure was not "hallucinated" -- it was a figure Kaebling used to
    quantify donations. My question was specifically if your private benefit from
    Microtome could have obviated the need for donations.


    Another point on efficiency -- your Web site has sections that are clearly out
    of date.


    I''d recommend that you rethink your claims of efficiency. So far, all I see is
    corner-cutting, a lack of operational know-how, and an outdated Web site that
    doesn''t even have its current information updated. You may be posting a lot of
    papers, but you''re not doing some core activities well as a business, management
    team, or non-profit organization, and if your involvement Stuart is also as a
    trustee or other key individual at JMLR, my personal and somewhat informed opinion
    is that your ownership and private/personal benefit from Microtome seems potentially
    in conflict with the laws dictating how non-profits are to be run.'

  content: 'Mr. Anderson,


    It appears you are either not reading or comprehending the clearly presented information,
    and certainly not taking into account the corrections and additional information
    supplied by representatives of Microtome or JMLR.


    First, obvious to this outsider from the information presented, Microtome and
    JMLR are separate legal entities. The former being a sole proprietorship, not
    a non-profit. The latter a non-profit with, as you state, a current lapse in that
    status. (It is still fair to call them a non-profit, assuming the first nine years
    they did have non-profit status, and given the statement they are attempting to
    re-establish non-profit status.) Second, Microtome has a business contract with
    JMLR to produce print copies. JMLR is not entitled to any of the proceeds unless
    specified in the contract.


    As for the donations, it was initially reported to be $7000, but corrected by
    Kaelbling to be $3500. This a remarkably small amount over an 12-year history.
    Even $7000 over 12 years is fairly minimal.


    To be absolutely clear, I have absolutely no connection to either business or
    persons involved in the above named organizations. However, I find it bothersome
    that while you have taken the time to hunt for non-profit status filings, your
    apparent bias has prevented you from clearly seeing or understanding the information
    presented. Additionally, your patronizing attitude, such as "you seem to believe
    in fairies" and "it’s nice there’s a little journal like this in computer science",
    is completely unprofessional and undermining any shred of credibility you may
    have once possessed.'

  content: 'A few responses:


    1. As for my attitude toward Elsevier''s fake journals, we covered it, and shamed
    them, at the Scholarly Kitchen, both promptly and consistently.


    2. My questions about Microtome, Scheiber, and JMLR are multiple. For instance,
    if JMLR needed $3,500 to manage some activities, and Scheiber was a trustee or
    key individual at JMLR, and he diverted some revenues from JMLR to himself, this
    would be a big problem. That''s what I can''t seem to get clear. Contract or no
    contract, that would be wrong.


    3. Asserting that JMLR is still a non-profit despite it having lost that status
    is an act of imagination. And you wonder why I accused people here of believing
    in faeries.


    4. My credibility isn''t compromised at all. I''ve helped improve and develop
    many successful journals, created major services that most journals now take for
    granted, and innovated in many ways over my career. I have no interest in the
    status quo except those parts that work and need no improvement. You tell me how
    a shoddy non-profit that can''t manage to file its papers is "innovative" in that
    regard. Please.


    So, someone provide evidence that Scheiber didn''t divert monies from JMLR to
    himself through his role at JMLR, and I''ll be happy.


    Thanks.'

  content: 'Mr. Anderson,


    Returning to this discussion is likely akin to the proverb about teaching a pig
    to sing, but it is my time to waste.


    The last available public charity (PC) filing for JMLR, Inc. is for fiscal year
    (FY) 2010, not absent the "THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS" you claim above. Additionally,
    the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not list JMLR, Inc. on either its PC [non-compliance](http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/nonprofit/july-2011-noncompliance.pdf)
    or [deactivated](http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/nonprofit/april-2010-deactivated-organizations.pdf)
    lists. Furthermore, Massachusetts law ([Part I, Title II, Chapter 12, Section
    8F](http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter12/Section8F))
    states "the trustee or trustees or the governing board of every public charity
    shall annually, at a time to be determined by the director, file with the division
    a written report for its last preceding fiscal year". The timing chosen by the
    director is unknown to me, but it is reasonable to consider that the FY 2011 filing
    may not actually be late. Another potential is that the annual filing was submitted,
    but the Massachusetts Attorney General''s office has not yet made it available
    online. A third option, as mentioned previously, is that filing was delinquent
    and, given the slow pace of government, the true status is known only to those
    involved at JMLR, Inc. and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Finally, the fourth
    possibility, is that JMLR, Inc. has indeed lost its non-profit status as you assert.
    However, if you have proof of your assertion, such as a statement by the Massachusetts
    Attorney General''s office, of their lost non-profit status please provide it.
    Otherwise, I stand by my imaginative statement that it is still fair to call JMLR,
    Inc. a non-profit.


    I agree, that if "Scheiber was a trustee or key individual at JMLR, and he diverted
    some revenues from JMLR to himself, this would be a big problem". However, until
    partially clarified in your most recent post, your line of inquiry has assumed
    that Scheiber IS "a trustee or key individual at JMLR" with nothing to support
    that assumption. I cannot assert Scheiber is not "a trustee or key individual
    at JMLR", but neither is there evidence to support that he is one. He is not listed
    on the any of the JMLR board rosters, nor is there any connection to JMLR, other
    than as JMLR''s archival publisher, listed on any of his internet biographies.
    Finally, as Kaelbling previously stated, "Microtome’s and JMLR’s finances are
    entirely separate. We just have a publishing agreement with Microtome". Meaning
    the revenues gained from publishing belong to Microtome NOT to JMLR, Inc., and
    any revenue to JMLR, Inc. from publishing is determined by the agreement between
    JMLR, Inc. and Microtome. If the agreement between JMLR, Inc. and Microtome stipulates
    that JMLR, Inc. does not receive any share of the revenue Microtome gains from
    publishing JMLR then there are no "diverted" revenues. Surely you still have questions,
    and will no doubt continue to raise them.


    For the time being this is all the time I am willing to waste.'
