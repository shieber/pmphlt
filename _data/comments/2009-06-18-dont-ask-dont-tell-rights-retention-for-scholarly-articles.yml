  content: "Interesting, Stu. I [blogged](http://kaivonfintel.org/2009/01/27/mea-culpa/)\
    \ about my mistake of publishing with Wiley/Blackwell in \"Philosophical Perspectives\"\
    \ (which is an annual supplement to Nous, the journal you're talking about). The\
    \ supplement for Nous requires a 24 (!) month embargo, even though you report\
    \ that the mother journal has dropped the embargo! \n\nYou are absolutely right\
    \ that everyone should be careful about signing away their intellectual ownership\
    \ rights. Even more importantly, people who agree to be editors or serve on editorial\
    \ boards should make sure that the journal they are agreeing to work for doesn't\
    \ have egregious terms in their authors' agreements."

  content: 'Excellent and informative post on academic publishing. I believe this
    "don''t ask don''t tell'' situation you describe exists for the same reason why
    universities generally tend to avoid enforcing copyright ownership of faculty
    work through the work-for-hire provisions of the Copyright Act: to do so would
    cause so much upset that the universities figure it is better to let sleeping
    dogs lie comfortably. (We concede the analogy does not fit exactly, since many
    universities have articulated policies in which they essentially disclaim work-for-hire
    ownership, whereas in this situation, it seems the publisher and the author seem
    to agree to a policy not in the author''s favor.) Unfortunately, this means everyone
    lives in a nether world of misunderstanding, confusion, and ignorance. Personally,
    we''d prefer to know up front exactly what the position is rather than leave it
    unstated.'

  content: "A couple reactions: \nFirst, I am impressed at your diligence in this\
    \ regard. How many authors actually read these copyright transfers in detail before\
    \ they sign and return them?  In life, we are bombarded by these licenses and\
    \ contracts every day, and we for the most part click through or sign in assent\
    \ waving all sorts of rights away without a second thought.  Companies have trained\
    \ us to think that we have no right to respond or amend these agreements, which\
    \ is simply not the case.\n\nI had a very similar experience a few years back\
    \ when publishing an article in an Elsevier journal.  At first, the staff was\
    \ acquiescent about the contract addendum, probably until it reached a management\
    \ level, who opposed it.  Eventually, a license was signed - not the standard\
    \ copyright transfer.  A separate agreement to post the article to our website\
    \ was agreed subsequently, with not cost or fuss.\n\nOne other point to add: Faculty\
    \ also are in the position to choose how they consider P&T criteria.  A tenure\
    \ committee could begin taking into account more than just the title in which\
    \ an article appears?  Weight could be given to openness and a willingness to\
    \ share, rather than just a publications reputation.  You rightly point out that\
    \ the promotion and tenure process drives this system.  However, it is the faculty\
    \ who decide what those criteria are.  Changing the underlying system that is\
    \ the real driver of the current publication process will have more of an impact\
    \ than any copyright addendum."

  content: "Wow, that is an impressive breakdown of the issue. Thanks for writing\
    \ this up. \n\nForced to make a decision, I'd have a hard time not sharing my\
    \ knowledge with as many people as possible, which would mean publishing it to\
    \ the web in a manner that's easily indexed by search engines. That's going to\
    \ generate the greatest exposure among interested parties."

  content: Great post, but since Harvard requires (I think) open access, possibly
    not such an important issue for you (depending on your tenure situation and the
    P+T committee rules). However, at many other academic institutions, this is a
    very important issue. Thanks again! (I looked at your paper - clever argument:-)

  content: '"on scholarly communication"


    It would seem a bit more scholarly if your font selection was friendlier to people
    with visual disabilities.


    (The default font size on your site is illegible in my browser; I had to magnify
    it 6x before I could read it.)


    Just sayin''.'

  content: If publishers aren't protecting their rights, big whoop! For years publishers
    have generated huge profits at the expense of authors. It's nice to see the tables
    turning, thanks to the internet.

  content: I think you said it best with how they pursue, or don't pursue actually,
    in that it would have a chilling effect.  The proliferation of information is
    what keeps higher learning institutions alive.  It's funny though, that it seems
    to be the unwritten rule in exchanging information that, if known to the publisher,
    would cause a strain in the relationship between the parties.

  content: It's only a matter of time before the "don't ask don't tell" game just
    becomes a game of "don't".  As soon as the publishers start to lose a signifigant
    amount of revune (and I think we are there now), they will begin asking and they
    will begin enforcing all contracts.  I've recently experienced this, and my publisher
    was very firm with their request for me to honor the contract to the letter.

  content: 'The basic tenet at law is if your person, property or reputation is damaged
    by a "tort", you are entitled to damages to the extent that your person, property
    or reputation is restored to the position that existed before the "tort", however
    AND this is the big HOWEVER, if you don''t act with reasonable speed to seek redress
    the courts will generally look at your plea for relief with disfavor.


    QED .. Authors who accept a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to online distribution
    of articles should not expect a wealthy retirement.'

  content: It's not bad that publishers aren't protecting their rights! For a very
    long time publishers have generated huge profits at the expense of authors. It's
    nice to finally see that it's turned around, this is all thanks to the internet!

  content: Publishers really need to update their processes for dealing with online
    publication. In most cases they are never losing out when a paper is published
    on a blog or website as online instance only creates further awareness of the
    offline product - free marketing essentially.

  content: Online and digital have been huge disruptions to traditional business processes.
    And there really aren't many businesses as traditional as publishing. Intellectual
    property is not something that should be up for grabs just because it's easier
    to do so.

  content: A lot of authors sign copyright transfers without really knowing the details.
    I believe, if you can take so much time and effort to conduct a study, you should
    be able to spare a little time to read agreements that may take away your intellectual
    rights.
