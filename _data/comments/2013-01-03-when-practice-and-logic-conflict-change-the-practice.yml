  content: 'Excellent point, the ''punctuation in'' always seemed strange to me. Also,
    IIRC, doesn''t the usage you recommend make the quotation marks a bit more like
    the French guillemets?

    Regardless, perhaps this blog can be used to raise funds for the Campaign for
    Typographical Freedom.'

  content: "You have readers. I read you! I have you listed among my favorite blogs.\
    \ This is the first time I comment, however. \nI learned punctuation the British\
    \ way, that is, outside the quotation marks.  Upon reaching university in the\
    \ US, they made me change my whole schema around, so that now I automatically\
    \ do it within the marks. However, I think there are exceptions and sometimes\
    \ it does go outside, though I am not sure about that obscure rule. In Spanish,\
    \ however, a language I write and publish frequently in, the punctuation goes\
    \ outside.  I agree with you on principle, but I am more easygoing about it. \
    \ If an editor wants it inside, inside it goes. If he or she wants it outside,\
    \ outside it goes. I make my life easy!"
