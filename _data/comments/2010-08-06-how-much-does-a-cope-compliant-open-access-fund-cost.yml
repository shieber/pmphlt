  content: 'ON SOWING GREEN BEFORE HARVESTING GOLD


    For what it''s worth, my objections to COPE are not based on double-dipping; they
    are not even based on COPE per se. They are based on committing to COPE without
    first committing to mandating Green OA.


    It is good that COPE does not propose to fund hybrid Gold (where the journal continues
    to get paid for subscriptions, and also gets paid for those articles that pay
    extra to be made OA). That''s double-dipping -- though the publishers can (and
    some do) reply:


    "No, it''s not double-dipping, it''s just a safety net, in case the market ever
    swings toward Gold: For now, we will reduce our subscriptions to reflect any Gold
    OA revenues. If and when the transition is complete, it''s complete,:all revenues
    come from Gold OA fees, zero from subscriptions. Never any double-dipping."


    A safety net to preserve current revenue streams, regardless of their source.


    No, the ones who are double-dripping (sic) are the institutions, who are spending
    money on buying in subscriptions, and, whether they pay for hybrid Gold or pure-gold
    COPE journals (e.g., in the Springer/BMC "Membership Deal"), also spending money
    on Gold (scarce money, reputedly, given the years of agonizing over the serials
    crisis and journal price inflation).


    But even that would not matter, if the institutions were just to mandate Green
    OA first.


    But committing to paying for Gold OA of any description without first mandating
    Green OA strikes me as a real head-shaker. What we need is OA, not safety nets
    for publishers, Green OA mandates will bring us OA, 100% OA. Fiddling pre-emptively
    with the future of publishing will not.


    Stuart has made such a brilliant, unique contribution to OA in orchestrating Harvard''s
    historic Green OA mandate. I continue to feel perplexed as to to why he is squandering
    any of his considerable expertise and influence at this critical juncture on persuading
    universities to squander their scarce resources (no matter how minimally) on pre-emptive
    Gold (as a publishers'' safety net) without first persuading them to follow his
    own gloriously Green example first.'

  content: 'P.S. Upon reflection, I remembered that Stuart has actually given a hint
    of why he has become so preoccupied with Gold: Because one of the obstacles he
    had encountered in convincing faculty to vote-in a Green OA mandate by consensus,
    as Harvard FAS did, was (some) authors'' worries about publishers'' future.


    So maybe the preoccupation with creating a safety net for publishers is really
    for the (sense of) safety of authors, so they are more likely to vote-in a Green
    OA mandate by consensus?


    But the Harvard FAS''s historic consensus on Green OA came before any commitment
    to a Gold safety net. And the same is true of the over 150 other Green OA mandates
    worldwide to date (though most were adopted by presidential or provostial  wisdom,
    rather than waiting for faculty to come to any consensus).


    Wouldn''t a less costly and circuitous way of calming individuals'' concerns about
    the safety of publishers under Green OA mandates be to point out that if subscription
    publishing were ever caused to become unsustainable because of the availability
    of Green OA, the vast sums of money that institutions are now spending on subscriptions
    would then by the very same token be released as the "safety net" to pay for the
    conversion to Gold OA?


    Does the first step really have to be pre-emptive payment, even token payment,
    rather than just going ahead and mandating the Green and letting the future of
    publishing take care of itself, while the research community takes care of getting
    its research into the hands of all its intended users at long last, instead of
    just those whose institutions can afford a subscription?'

  content: 'So Prof. Harnad''s objections to [COPE](http://www.oacompact.org/) are
    not based on COPE.  I''m glad we got *that* cleared up.  Then perhaps he''ll stop
    saying things like "COPE is based on an illusion" when it''s not.


    As to whether I have "become so preoccupied with Gold [OA]": Scholarly publishing
    is a multifaceted problem. There are many actors and interests. Some of us confronted
    with a system of this complexity are able to entertain *more than one idea at
    a time* about the situation. Some of us on the other hand are stuck on one idea.
    They think that effort expended on any other ideas is a sign of "preoccupation",
    of "[fever](http://bit.ly/1SpgjW)". It wouldn''t be unreasonable to think that
    the preoccupation or fever is in the mind of the person unwilling to entertain
    more than one idea at a time even when those ideas are not inconsistent with each
    other, are, in fact, synergistic. Just saying.'
