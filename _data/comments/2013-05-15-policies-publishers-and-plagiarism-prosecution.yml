  content: 'You''re saying the publishers don''t need these rights transferred to
    them in order to prosecute plagiarism. Maybe their wording on this is so totally
    wrong because they don''t generally bother to seek out or prosecute plagiarism
    in the first place. If they did, they''d probably have a more nuanced or reasonable
    wording on the subject.

    Which just seems to confirm what we already know and you state, plagiarism has
    nothing to do with any of this.'
