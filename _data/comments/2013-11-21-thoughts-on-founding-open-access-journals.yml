  content: 'I''m on board with much of this though parts of it troubles me.  Some
    of the current mechanisms to fund "open access" publishing through author subvention
    present ethical quandaries especially when following the UK or proposed European
    models. The creation of mega-journal depots is also problematic so for a counter
    to the iTunes model of immediate and isolated article publication see my "Academic
    Journals in the Digital Era" where I argue for the journal as scholarly interactive

  content: "Thanks for bringing up these interesting issues. \n\nYou worry that a\
    \ funding model for OA journals based on author-side fees has ethical problems.\
    \ (“Author subvention” is a misleading term, since authors need not provide the\
    \ subvention. Universities and funding agencies can, should, and often do pay\
    \ author-side fees on behalf of authors, just as they pay [hyperinflating and\
    \ unustainable] reader-side fees on behalf of readers.) I’ve written about the\
    \ author-side funding model [extensively](http://bitly.com/bundles/shieber/2),\
    \ and argued that (i) [reader-side fees are more disenfranchising than author-side\
    \ fees](http://bit.ly/hXCqld), since you have to have access to read the literature\
    \ before you can contribute to it; (ii) [fee waivers open up participation to\
    \ all](http://bit.ly/hXCqld); (iii) [the structure of the author-side market is\
    \ far better](http://bit.ly/aMpbWp) than the manifestly dysfunctional reader-side\
    \ market, and will serve to keep author-side fees down. \n\nI agree that [the\
    \ current UK model is problematic](http://hvrd.me/12ZNz4V) in its support for\
    \ the problematic hybrid model and its requirement for publication in gold OA\
    \ journals. A far preferable approach would have been to require gold *or green*\
    \ OA and to make funds available to pay gold OA fees (but not hybrid) if authors\
    \ chose to go that route. \n\nI don’t understand your worry about [megajournals](http://bit.ly/hTyW99)\
    \ however. Journals can (and do) solicit and display articles thematically without\
    \ having “issues”. Indeed, online distribution means that this can be done even\
    \ more flexibly, allowing articles to be listed in multiple thematic special issues.\
    \ PLoS’s experiments with “hubs” and “[collections](http://www.ploscollections.org/)”\
    \ are along these lines."
