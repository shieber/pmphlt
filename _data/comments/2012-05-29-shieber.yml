  content: 'Stuart, this is a fabulous project! (It''s amazing what happens when students
    are set a problem and given freedom to solve it. I use this technique a lot in
    my own classes, and have yet to be disappointed.)


    Your students may be interested in reading about "More Product Less Process,"
    a lean-mean archival processing method argued for by Greene and Meissner ("More
    Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing" American Archivist
    68:208-263). MPLP has been extensively discussed in the archival literature; don''t
    stop at the article I just cited!


    MPLP lessons are now being applied to digitization of archival materials; I know
    that archivist Josh Ranger at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh has done
    (among other things) enlightening user-opinion surveys on MPLP digitization. I
    can try to dig up additional work in this area if that would be helpful.


    Your students'' work also comes at a crucial time in the evolution of archival-description
    software. The two dominant open-source packages in this area, Archon and Archivists''
    Toolkit, are merging into a new package called ArchivesSpace http://www.archivesspace.org/
    . I encourage your students to look into getting involved in development and testing!


    Disclaimer: I''m not an archivist myself; I only train a few of them in digital
    tools and techniques.'

  content: One step I am missing in this workflow is the licensing. Sure, many items
    in the special collections are old enough not to have this problem, but a good
    portion probably isn't. Having a standard protocol for when to license what in
    what way could really boost the reuse of such resources.

  content: '@Daniel: Yes, the issue of restricting access based on privacy and rights
    are very important, and received little discussion in the students'' work beyond  an
    understanding that provision needs to be made for archivists'' control over the
    public visibility of materials for these reasons. By the way, even out of copyright
    materials in the collection may have distribution issues by virtue of contractual
    obligations of the library from the donor, so age is not a sufficient criterion
    for distribution. More thought definitely needs to go into this as we proceed
    with the project.'

  content: '@Dorothea: Thanks for the pointers. MPLP is definitely the theme of the
    students'' proposals. There''s some use of Archivists'' Toolkit here at Harvard,
    but not at all of our special collections. I hope we''ll be able to look into
    these newer systems as well.'
