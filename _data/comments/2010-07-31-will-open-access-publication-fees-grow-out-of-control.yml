  content: 'THE PRICE OF SELECTIVITY NEED NOT BE ACCESS DENIED OR DELAYED


    Harnad, S. (2010) No-Fault Peer Review Charges: The Price of Selectivity Need
    Not Be Access Denied or Delayed. D-Lib Magazine 16 (7/8). http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21348/


    SUMMARY: Plans by universities and research funders to pay the costs of Open Access
    Publishing ("Gold OA") are premature. Funds are short; 80% of journals (including
    virtually all the top journals) are still subscription-based, tying up the potential
    funds to pay for Gold OA; the asking price for Gold OA is still high; and there
    is concern that paying to publish may inflate acceptance rates and lower quality
    standards. What is needed now is for universities and funders to mandate OA self-archiving
    (of authors'' final peer-reviewed drafts, immediately upon acceptance for publication)
    ("Green OA"). That will provide immediate OA; and if and when universal Green
    OA should go on to make subscriptions unsustainable (because users are satisfied
    with just the Green OA versions) that will in turn induce journals to cut costs
    (print edition, online edition, access-provision, archiving), downsize to just
    providing the service of peer review, and convert to the Gold OA cost-recovery
    model; meanwhile, the subscription cancellations will have released the funds
    to pay these residual service costs. The natural way to charge for the service
    of peer review then will be on a "no-fault basis," with the author''s institution
    or funder paying for each round of refereeing, regardless of outcome (acceptance,
    revision/re-refereeing, or rejection). This will minimize cost while protecting
    against inflated acceptance rates and decline in quality standards.'

    Access has many virtues, but saving money is not among them.

  content: 'There is the question of whether publication-fee OA journals are more
    economical than subscription-fee journals — maybe and maybe not — and then there
    is the question that Mr. Esposito raises in the cited article as to whether "OA
    will reduce costs to zero or some modest mark–up above zero".  The answer to the
    latter is of course "no, it won''t."  Does anyone really believe that straw man?


    But my post wasn''t about whether OA will save money or not; it was about whether
    the publication fee model is "economically precarious", and in particular whether
    publication fees are likely to hyperinflate.  Mr. Esposito''s interesting article
    covers a number of speculative topics — I recommend it to readers of this blog
    — but I couldn''t find any argument in it in support of D''s worry about publication-fee
    hyperinflation. Nor, by the way, could I find much of an argument that the publication-fee
    business model can''t save money as compared to the subscription-fee model.  Readers
    can judge for themselves.'

  content: Although there is a lot of talk about the value of the journal's imprimatur,
    I think the imprimatur itself is quite precarious.  If the editorial board of
    a journal becomes frustrated with the high price (as did the editorial board of
    Machine Learning when I was serving on it a decade ago), they can defect and start
    another journal (as many of us did). The cost of starting (and operating) a journal
    (especially in electronic form) is very low.  So the barriers to entry are low.  It
    is difficult to imagine maintaining a high-value imprimatur without the volunteer
    time of a high-quality editorial board.
