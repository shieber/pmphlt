  content: "I think you missed Phil's point, Stuart. \n\nWhat Phil was saying is that\
    \ libraries can't control the disbursement of open access fees precisely because\
    \ of academic freedom, which makes these fees more susceptible to unchecked growth\
    \ and possible abuse. If they establish an OA fund, librarians will be on the\
    \ horns of a dilemma -- allow unchecked spending or violate academic freedom.\
    \ Since they won't violate academic freedom, their only option will be to allow\
    \ unchecked spending.\n\nI think you're responding to a misinterpretation of Phil's\
    \ post."
