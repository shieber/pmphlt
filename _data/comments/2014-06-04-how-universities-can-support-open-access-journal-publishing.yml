  content: 'Great article!


    What would be your preferred model moving forward. I''m looking at how one could
    make a new open access publisher and currently considering what researchers needs
    are over publishers profits etc'

  content: '@Ben: If by “what model” you mean what business model open-access publishers
    should use, I’m all for experimentation. Some, like [JMLR](http://jmlr.org/),
    work [entirely on in-kind donations of time](http://bit.ly/wOnMEq); others use
    subventions from [scholarly societies](http://bit.ly/WsXHUF), universities, or
    other institutions; others charge author-side publication fees; a few (too few)
    charge submission fees. Several [lists](http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=347&Itemid=377)
    of [business models](http://gslis.simmons.edu/wikis/oadwiki/OA_journal_business_models)
    for OA journals have been compiled. I’m all for letting a thousand flowers bloom,
    and for [universities](http://bit.ly/4ocFRP) and [funding agencies](http://bit.ly/sLhk3H)
    to underwrite reasonable costs associated with those business models.'

  content: I agree that there should be innovation in this space but it does increase
    the access of materials if they're all over place with under differing licensing
    and fee walls. Sounds like more of the same to me, but I''m extremely new to is
    space

  content: Interesting model for open-access publishing. Am wondering how such a model
    can work in cash-strapped South-Asian universities/ institutions of higher learning
    ?

  content: '@Nandini — I recommend you take a look at my earlier post “[Are open-access
    fees disenfranchising?](http://bit.ly/hXCqld)”, which addresses your issue in
    detail. The summary is this: subscription fees are a more fundamental barrier
    for indigent researchers, and publication fees need not be a barrier given appropriate
    waiver policies.'
