  content: "COMMIT TO PROVIDING GREEN OA BEFORE COMMITTING TO PAY FOR GOLD OA\n\n\
    I've said this so often now, unheeded, that all I can do is echo it yet again:\
    \ \n\nRegardless of the size of the asking price (\"reasonable\" or unreasonable),\
    \ it is an enormous strategic mistake for a university or research funder to commit\
    \ to pre-emptive payment of Open Access Journal Publishing fees (Gold OA) until\
    \ and unless the university or funder has first mandated Green OA self-archiving\
    \ for all of its own published journal article output (regardless of whether published\
    \ in OA or non-OA journals).\n\nThere are so far five signatories to the \"Compact\
    \ for Open-Access Equity.\" Two of them have mandated Green OA (Harvard and MIT)\
    \ and three have not (Cornell, Dartmouth, Berkeley). Many non-mandating universities\
    \ have also been committing to the the pre-emptive SCOAP3 consortium. \n\nIf Harvard's\
    \ and MIT's example is followed, and Green OA mandates grow globally ahead of\
    \ Gold OA commitments, then there's no harm done. \n\nBut if it is instead pre-emptive\
    \ commitments to fund Gold OA that grow, at the expense of mandates to provide\
    \ Green OA, then the worldwide research community will yet again have shot itself\
    \ in the foot insofar as universal OA -- so long within its reach, yet still not\
    \ grasped -- is concerned.\n\nHarnad, S. (1991) Post-Gutenberg Galaxy: The Fourth\
