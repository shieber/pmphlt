  content: "GOLD CONVERSION: A PRISONERS' DILEMMA\n\nFor what it's worth, I agree\
    \ completely about Gold OA \"membership\" (and have posted about it many, many\
    \ times):  http://bit.ly/membership-subscription \n\nBut a little further reflection\
    \ should also reveal that much the same arguments can be made against pre-emptive\
    \ COPE funding: There is nothing wrong with institutions redirecting a portion\
    \ of their subscription-cancelation savings toward paying for their authors' Gold\
    \ OA publication fees -- once Green OA self-archiving has been universally mandated\
    \ by all institutions (not just locally, as at Harvard) and the resulting universal\
    \ Green OA has caused universal subscription cancelation by all institutions.\
    \ That will not only have driven down the price of publication to the bare essentials\
    \ (peer review only, with the global network of Green institutional repositories\
    \ now providing all access and archiving in place of journal publishers), but\
    \ it will have released the institutional (incoming subscription cancelation)\
    \ money to pay for the institution's own outgoing Gold OA publication fees several\
    \ times over.\n\nBut fund COPE now, preemptively, before Green OA is universally\
    \ mandated and before the universal cancelation windfall savings exist to pay\
    \ for Gold OA and all you do is slow the growth of Green OA mandates and prop\
    \ up the current asking price for Gold OA -- and all that out of money you don't\
    \ even have yet, paying to provide OA that can be provided for free if it is simply\
    \ mandated!\n\nThe reason: An institution cannot unilaterally cancel a (needed)\
    \ journal until its contents are all freely accessible to its users. A local mandate\
    \ won't make that happen; only global mandates can."
