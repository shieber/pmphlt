  content: "USEFUL  CLARIFICATIONS AND SIMPLIFICATIONS: BUT PRACTICAL CONTINGENCIES\
    \ STILL THREE, NOT TWO\n\nStuart Shieber's recommendations are very good and their\
    \ spirit should be followed, because that would indeed simplify and clarify the\
    \ UNT policy, currently somewhat longer and more complicated than it needs to\
    \ be. \n\nBut there is an even simpler way to put it (though it does involve three\
    \ components, not just two): (1) Immediate deposit required. (2) Immediate OA\
    \ strongly recommended, but not required. (3) Rights retention and license strongly\
    \ recommended, but not required. That's all. \n\nStuart's recommendations for\
    \ simplifying the rights reservation and licensing details are well taken; and\
    \ they do make the policy as a whole more consistent and coherent. But (1) and\
    \ (3) alone, leaving out (2), would not make it clear enough to authors what the\
    \ real contingencies are, even though Stuart is quite right that, by implication,\
    \ (2) is in a sense implicit in (3). Waiving (3), however, does not entail waiving\
    \ (2), any more than waiving (2) or (3) implies waiving (1).\n\nThere is no Harvard-style\
    \ vs Harnad-style approach. That initial difference  vanished completely as soon\
    \ as the Harvard mandate added an immediate-deposit requirement, without waiver,\
    \ to its original license requirement, with waiver: http://bit.ly/HarvardOA\n\n\
    The rest is just about clarifying the contingencies. (1) Yes, you have to deposit\
    \ immediately, no matter what. (2) No, you don't have to make the deposit OA immediately,\
    \ if you have reason not to; it is just strongly recommended. (3) No, you don't\
    \ have to reserve the specified rights and grant the license if you have reason\
    \ not to, it is just strongly recommended. \n\nI think the current Harvard version\
    \ still does not make the three contingencies sufficiently clear and explicit\
    \ (although they are latent in the Harvard FAQ), whereas the UNT version does.\
    \ Streamlined along the lines Stuart suggests, UNT will do so even better.\n\n\
    Ceterum censeo, I am confident that the extra rights that Harvard seeks in (3)\
    \ (basically amounting to \"Libre OA\") will eventually come with the IDOA territory,\
    \ following as a natural matter of course, with time, once the IDOA version of\
    \ the OA mandate becomes widely adopted. IDOA guarantees only about 63% immediate\
    \ Gratis OA plus 37% \"Almost-OA\" today. But once it is universally adopted,\
    \ the rest of the dominoes will fall, leading first to 100% Gratis OA, and then\
    \ to as much Libre OA as authors and institutions want and need. The trick is\
    \ to come up with a policy model, today, that is strong enough to do the trick\
    \ -- not so strong as to impede or retard universal adoption, but strong enough\
    \ to ensure compliance: I think the UNT version (with Stuart's recommended tightening)\
    \ will prove to be that optimal model."

  content: '*"There is no Harvard-style vs Harnad-style approach."* Well, yes, there
    *is* a difference. A Harvard-style policy retains rights by default. A Harnad-style
    policy requires authors to take some overt action to retain rights.


    I appreciate that you don''t think that rights retention is important, but that
    doesn''t mean there isn''t a difference.


    The interesting thing about the UNT variant (at least as modified above) is that
    it does do rights retention by virtue of passing the policy itself, while sticking
    to whatever restrictions publishers place. Personally, I''d rather see rights
    retention in a much broader way, but if one is not going to do so, the above is
    an interesting middle ground, which goes beyond an ID/OA approach in rights retention
    but not as far as a Harvard-style policy.'

  content: "OA IS AND ALWAYS WAS JUST A MATTER OF KEYSTROKES\n\nThe substantive differences\
    \ between the two model \"styles,\" if any, are tiny. \n\nWhat I think UNT has\
    \ done is to make the real contingencies much more explicit, foregrounding the\
    \ ID/OA aspect: (1) immediate deposit is required [\"mandatory'], whereas the\
    \ rest -- (2) setting access as OA and (3) retaining/licensing rights) -- are\
    \ both optional; i.e., (2) and (3) can be \"waived,\" can be \"opted-out\" from,\
    \ hence they are not really \"required,\" not mandatory. \n\nIt is that transparency\
    \ about what is required and what is not that makes UNT a more universally adoptable\
    \ model than the Harvard model, in which the contingencies (though substantively\
    \ the same) are (I think) not made explicit enough so that universities considering\
    \ adoption can see exactly what they are and are not committing themselves to.\n\
    \nID/OA is just as compatible with designating (2) and (3) the \"default\" option,\
    \ which can be waived, or opted-out from, in individual cases, if the author provides\
    \ a reason. It all comes to the same thing: (1) You must deposit, no opt-out;\
    \ (2) you must make the deposit immediately OA, but you may opt out, on an individual\
    \ case-by-case basis, with reasons; (3) you must retain/license rights, but you\
    \ may opt out, on an individual case-by-case basis, with reasons.\n\nThe logic\
    \ and obligations are the same. The contingencies are simply more transparent\
    \ in UNT's formulation of ID/OA, with the result that the immediate deposit requirement\
    \ is the unambiguous cornerstone of the requirement, because it has no opt-out.\n\
    \nGiven OA's lamentably long 20-year history of cop-outs, nothing is more important\
    \ today than to get the opt-outs of a mandate model up-front, so all those worries\
    \ about publishers and rights -- the ones that tend to turn university OA policies\
    \ into empty restatements of publisher policies! -- are alleviated and the all-important\
    \ core (mandatory deposit, no exceptions) is unmistakable, hence inescapable.\
    \ What is and has been needed all along is a mandate that will ensure that the\
    \ *deposit keystrokes* get done, without fasil: once those deposit keystrokes\
    \ are getting done globally, all the rest of will come with the territory, as\
    \ a natural matter of course. (Trust me!)"
