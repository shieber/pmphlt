  content: 'THE ARGUMENT AGAINST (PREMATURE) GOLD OA SUPPORT


    I have written a response to

    http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2009/06/11/the-argument-for-gold-oa-support/

    "The argument for gold OA support" by Stuart Shieber.


    The full response is at:

    http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/590-guid.html "The

    Argument Against (Premature) Gold OA Support"


    Here is just the summary:


    What is needed in order to provide universal OA as quickly and surely

    as possible is for universities (and funders) to mandate that their

    own researchers provide (Green) OA by depositing their articles in

    their institution''s OA repository immediately upon acceptance for

    publication. It is both a strategic and a conceptual mistake to think

    that money has to be spent at this time on paying for publishing in

    Gold OA journals. Gold OA journals'' time will come if and when

    universal Green OA makes subscriptions unsustainable. Then publishers

    will cut costs and downsize to just providing the service of managing

    peer review, paid for by institutions out of their windfall

    subscription cancellation savings. Universities and funders should not

    be either distracted or deterred from mandating Green OA now by

    thinking that they first need to provide funds to pay for Gold OA.

    (Once they have adopted a Green OA mandate, this is no longer a

    distraction or deterrent and they can of course do whatever they like

    with their spare cash.)


    (1) Any needless cost at all associated with adopting and implementing

    a Green OA mandate is a deterrent to arriving at consensus on

    adoption, not an incentive.


    (2) Minimal costs for Harvard U are not necessarily minimal for HaveNot U.


    (3) The way to explain the possible eventual transition to universal

    Gold OA is via its causal antecedent: universal Green OA.


    (4) The way to allay worries about Learned Society Publishersâ€™ future

    after universal Green OA is to explain the simple, straightforward

    relation between institutional subscription collapse and institutional

    subscription cancellation savings, and how it releases the funds to

    continue paying for publication via Gold OA. (And remind faculty that

    if their institutions really want to keep subsidizing Learned Society

    publishers'' "good works" (conferences, scholarships, lobbying) as they

    are now through subscription-fees, they can certainly continue to do

    so through publication fees too, as a surcharge, on the Gold OA model,

    if they wish.)


    (5) Reserve any plans for promoting pre-emptive payment of Gold OA

    fees for those institutions that have already mandated Green OA (and

    preferably only after we are further along the road from 85 mandates

    to 10,000!).


    (6) Pre-emptive payment for Gold OA before universal Green OA just

    retards and distracts from providing and mandating Green OA. Moreover,

    it is incoherent and does not scale ("universalize"): It is like an

    Escher drawing, leading nowhere, even though it seems to.

  content: 'Prof. Shieber:


    Thank you for this eloquent and persuasive post.  If I understand correctly, you
    are making an empirical argument: that in your experience, faculties will not
    vote to implement Green OA unless institutional support for Gold OA is also implemented.  That
    is, you are making the empirical claim that a commitment to institutional support
    for Gold OA is a necessary condition of persuading faculties to implement Green
    OA.  Is that accurate?  If it is, I would think that this empirical claim could
    be verified empirically, say, by surveying the faculties that have not implemented
    Green OA respecting what they consider to be the necessary conditions for persuading
    them to implement Green OA.'

    Good observations here!

  content: The adoption of the green OA policy might subsequently lead to a reduction
    in the available funds for research. If libraries cancel subscriptions and publishers
    can no longer recoup their costs, journals will be shut down. Most funders traditionally
    prefer to see hard copies of finished works rather than online copies.
