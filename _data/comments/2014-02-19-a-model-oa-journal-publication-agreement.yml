    Thanks for your comments. The agreement was intended as a model, but some may
    want to make changes for their purposes. Still, the particular concerns you raise
    are, I believe, adequately handled in the current language. Here’s why I think
    so.


    I find clause 3 of this model agreement troubling. This is an agreement between
    an author and publisher, and clause 3 is binding on the author. But the author
    is not in a position to require that everyone in the world cite the original publication.

    Authors certainly are in a position to so require others, simply by relaying the
    attribution requirement. (Of course, authors are in no position to police compliance
    with the requirement, but that’s another matter, and they are not required to
    do so by the agreement.) That could be done simply by the author not deleting
    the appropriate attribution information that the publisher itself provides in
    the original article. Nonetheless, this clause was intended as protection for
    the publisher. If the publisher doesn’t want that protection, it can be dropped.


    Perhaps, though, the publisher intends to add a statement to the published version
    of the article saying that it’s licensed under a CC-BY but with the additional
    requirement that anyone using it cite the original publication. If you do that,
    you’re imposing an additional term beyond those in CC-BY, so claiming the article
    is made available under CC-BY is now a bit of a fib.


    That’s exactly what I had in mind. Such a requirement does not go beyond CC-BY,
    which already specifies in [Section 3.A.1.a.i](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3)
    that licensors may require “identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material
    and any others designated to receive attribution, *in any reasonable manner requested
    by the Licensor*”. (Emphasis added.)



    Since a publisher representative will also sign the agreement, you might want
    to require an action of the publisher, such as actually publishing the work in
    the journal.



    That’s effectively what the last sentence of paragraph 7 does.'

    I don''t think so. The CC license is not granted to the publisher but to the general
    public (so that the publisher, and others, can avail themselves of the license).


    I particularly liked Clause 5!


    Me too. This is the one part of the agreement that I''ve never seen any publication
    agreement include. It ought to eliminate any worry about published versions being
    derivative works, and hence requiring separate licenses.'

    this is a great proposal. I do think, that it is a viable agreement and it would
    be beneficial if adapted by different publishers.


    We at ScienceOpen.com will use this agreement for our pblications.


    Thanks for your work!

  content: 'Micah ,


    I take it that the intent of this addition to the warrants in Paragraph 6 is that
    the author would additionally be warranting that the use of the specified material
    falls under fair use. The idea would be to protect the publisher in case someone
    came along later and claimed infringement for the material by being able to pass
    the buck to the author. (“Not our fault. The author told us that it was a fair
    use.”)


    If that’s right, I’d think some wordsmithing would be useful. First, the use of
    the passive obscures that it is the author who is to be put on record as making
    the claim of fair use. But more fundamentally, the warrant by the author shouldn’t
    be the author’s claim of fair use (that’s trivial to provide), but the fair use
    itself. So, it might be better to rephrase as “If the Work contains any material
    for which the Author does not hold copyright and for which the Author has not
    obtained rights to distribute or make available, use of that material is a fair
    use.”


    Such a provision might be a good thing to add, depending on how much additional
    protection it actually provides to the publisher. And here I have to defer to
    the experts. Any copyright lawyers want to weigh in?'

  content: 'Stuart and Micah,

    The "fair use" provision just doesn''t work that way.  As an affirmative defense
    to infringement, disputes about fair use can only be resolved upon the decision
    of a court on a case-by-case basis.  The only exception is if the copyright holder
    ("owner") expressly agrees that it considers a particular use to be covered by
    fair use, which may then preempt an infringement action. When we talk about "fair
    use" prospectively, it can never be more than just a claim.


    An author who submits an article containing material under copyright by a third
    party may BELIEVE it to be a fair use, but the only person who can contractually
    agree that it IS a fair use is the actual copyright holder. This means that the
    "wordsmithed" version proposed means either that the author has obtained permission
    or a court order, or that s/he is making an untrue representation in a contract,
    which is bad news for the author.


    Technically, term 6c already addresses this, putting the author on the hook for
    any use of third party copyrights without permission if that use turns out to
    be an infringement.  However, Micah is correct that journal publishers do care
    a great deal about this.


    Also, there are some overall drafting and language issues that might be worth
    addressing in this model agreement to tighten it up (defined terms not capitalized,
    unusual phrasing, mixed-purpose terms).'

  content: "Peter,\n\nVery useful comments. Thanks for pointing out the Michigan agreement.\
    \ I hadn't seen that before. It looks like a model approach as well, differing\
    \ in just a couple of ways.\n\nIt certainly satisfies my desiderata of paragraphs\
    \ 1, 3, part of 4, and 6, though not 2, the rest of 4, 5, and (as you note) 7.\
    \ \n\nThe biggest difference is that it does not lead to a grant of an open license\
    \ to the general public, taking a different approach. The author provides what,\
    \ as far as I can tell, is a nonexclusive license to the publisher to exercise\
    \ all of copyright (but why does it take 136 words to do so?), so that the publisher\
    \ can then grant a CC-BY or other license to the public. This has the advantage,\
    \ as you say, that if in the future some other license would be preferable to\
    \ use, the publisher can modify its grant to the public without needing to get\
    \ further permission from the author. I'd think the odds that a CC-BY will be\
    \ determined to be insufficiently broad at some time in the future, thereby necessitating\
    \ the publisher to grant an even broader license, seems like a slim prospect at\
    \ best. On the down side, the author has no guarantee that the publisher will\
    \ actually use the rights to grant a broad license. But this is probably not a\
    \ big deal, for if the publisher reneged on the implicit promise of a CC-BY license\
    \ in A.3, it would get terrible PR.\n\nParagraph 5, which makes sure that the\
    \ publisher's version falls under the CC license as well, may be (indeed probably\
    \ is) unnecessary. Nonetheless, authors often act as if they think they can't\
    \ distribute publisher versions because of some magic IP dust the publisher sprinkles\
    \ on it, so clarity may not be a bad thing. You're exactly right that \"The changes\
    \ that a publisher make should never be original enough to warrant their own copyright\
    \ protection.\" That's why Paragraph 5 has \"The publisher agrees to verify with\
    \ you any such edits that are substantive\", so that the author is a participant\
    \ in any nontrivial changes, the kind that could conceivably (though even still\
    \ not necessarily) have copyright implications.\n\nSimilarly, I'd be happy to\
    \ drop the indemnification clause of Paragraph 6, though some journals might not\
    \ want to do so.\n\nFinally, I would happily drop the extra two sentences of \"\
    legal mumbo-jumbo\" of Paragraph 7 that go beyond what is in Michigan's Paragraph\
    \ E, namely \"It will be governed by the laws of […the Commonwealth of Massachusetts…].\
    \ It will bind and benefit our respective assigns and successors in interest,\
    \ including your heirs.\" I inherited that from other agreements, but if the lawyers\
    \ say it's not necessary, it's gone."

  content: 'Matt,


    This is exactly what I thought. All that adding the “fair use” clause does is
    have the authors warrant that all the stuff that doesn’t have explicit permission
    is a fair use. They would only sign if they believed it to be so, and they’d be
    on the hook if a court decided otherwise. But as you say, even without the fair
    use clause, the same would happen. If some material wasn’t explicitly licensed
    and a court decided it wasn’t a fair use, 6c already would have the authors on
    the hook.


    The defined terms not being capitalized was based on conversation with legal advisers
    that capitalization is not required (and I always thought it a bit hokey). Is
    there some legal benefit to the practice? And I appreciate your not wanting to
    clutter the comment thread with wordsmithing, but I’d happily receive recommendations
    “[offline](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/contact.html)” for fixing unusual
    phrasing and mixed-purpose terms too.


    Thanks!'
