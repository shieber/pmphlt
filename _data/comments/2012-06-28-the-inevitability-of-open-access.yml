    \ we're still compos mentis, we better stop mumbling about Gold and start mandating\
    \ Green. \n\n(That's certainly not what the authors of many of these pronouncements\
    \ are on about, least of all those of Dame Janet; they're musing about the future\
    \ of publishing, not the future of research.)"

  content: 'Neelie Kroes, Vice President of the European Commission is a strong advocate
    for open access.  She has made a number of speeches on OA.  Here''s an example:


    "Open access is a legal and technical reality today. The question is no longer
    ‘if’ we should have open access. The question is about ‘how’ we should develop
    it further and promote it."

  content: Totally agree David. The just released Finch report which I blogged here
    - http://wp.me/p2mHsp-M - points in this direction even though it is already attracting
    some controversy. Open Access advocates should rise up and openly debate these
    issues. Just for the record, personally, I am for full Open Access publishing.
