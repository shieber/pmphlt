  content: "Even if current \"true average revenue per article\" were the verifiable\
    \ basis of the Gold OA article publishing fee, and even if double-dipping were\
    \ verifiably preventable, and all excess revenue were verifiably translated into\
    \ subscription reductions, how would this prevent the current \"true average revenue\
    \ per article\" from being locked in, preventing further cost-cutting with time?\
    \ Between-journal competition? \nAN ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nThere's an awful lot\
    \ bundled into that \"true average revenue per article\" today: print edition,\
    \ online edition, archiving, preservation, dissemination, marketing, fulfillment.\
    \ Would a locked-in price allow any reliable way to downsize to, say, just providing\
    \ peer review, if that's in the cards? (This problem is not exclusive to hybrid\
    \ Gold OA: it applies to full Gold OA too.)\n\nAnd I would describe the overall\
    \ situation -- both with hybrid OA and with full OA \"membership\" -- not so much\
    \ as a prisoner's dilemma but an evolutionary unstable strategy. The cause of\
    \ the instability is pre-emptive Gold OA payment of any kind, while subscriptions\
    \ still rule the roost, journals are still co-bundling many obsolescent products\
    \ and services, and we don't yet have OA.\n\nOne reliable way to scale down the\
    \ co-bundled extras -- if that's in the cards -- is indeed competition, but from\
    \ (mandated, universal) Green OA. \n\nIf you can access the content for free,\
    \ you are unlikely to want to pay for the paper edition, the print edition, online\
    \ edition, archiving, preservation, dissemination, marketing, fulfillment, any\
    \ which way. Moreover, the worldwide distributed network of institutional repositories\
    \ providing the Green OA content would also be the natural way to offload the\
    \ distributed cost of archiving, preservation and all access-provision.\n\nAnd\
    \ another advantage would be that with Green OA there is no need to provide any\
    \ pre-emptive Gold payment today at all (except to keep the principle of a transition\
    \ to Gold OA primed in the wings)... OA first; then we talk about the true cost\
    \ of the underlying service. Not locking in the \"true average revenue per article\"\
    \ today.\n\nJust a thought, on alternative scenarios perhaps worth considering."

  content: 'I often find myself agreeing with Professor Harnad.  First and foremost,
    we agree on the primary conclusion of my post, that institutions should not at
    present underwrite hybrid OA fees.  We also agree on the utility of self-archiving,
    and efforts to increase the practice; his many activities to this end are worthy
    of the strongest support.  I plan on writing a full response to Professor Harnad''s
    important question "[H]ow would this prevent the current ''true average revenue
    per article'' from being locked in, preventing further cost-cutting with time?"
    in a later post.  But I cannot allow his statement "OA first; then we talk about
    the true cost of the underlying service" to pass unremarked.


    Professor Harnad is welcome to his well-known and oft-repeated opinions on whether
    OA journals should be supported or not, but to abjure any *talk* about the issue
    is inconsistent with the very premise behind open access, which is free and open
    discussion.  Mere repetition of arguments does not provide them with further foundation,
    and may in fact be counterproductive to their promotion.  Nonetheless, in the
    case of speech with which one disagrees, "the remedy to be applied", as [Justice
    Brandeis said](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0274_0357_ZC.html),
    "is more speech, not enforced silence."'

  content: "I am not very familiar with the publication model you are advocating,\
    \ hence my question:\nIf you are successful in establishing this particular OA\
    \ publication model, does every author (or his/her institute) have to pay for\
    \ publication of his/her articles?\nHow about authors who work in the areas of\
    \ inquiry where funding is not very widespread? \nI personally can usually fund\
    \ my main line of research, but there are some side-lines which I continue to\
    \ work on but cannot find any funding for them. I think that is not because those\
    \ areas are worthless. They are just not very fashionable these now. My experience\
    \ is that if you keep working on some forgotten areas and give them living, suddenly\
    \ a lot of people become interested and see the point of your research. If I had\
    \ to pay for publishing my papers, I could never publish them because there simply\
    \ was no funding for the research. But, I could publish my work and after couple\
    \ of years people are seeing the advantages of my approach and citing the work.\
    \ The conditions are even worse for researchers who work in developing countries\
    \ where funding is scarce. I know some of the OA journals may waive the publication\
    \ fee if the author is not able to pay the fee. But I can tell you that it does\
    \ not feel good to apply for fee waiver. \nThe bottom line is that I do not think\
    \ payment of publication fee from funding money should become the rule of publication."

  content: '@Amir:  Great questions. Just as universities and funding agencies are
    now the source of funds for the subscription-based business model, I''d expect
    they would continue under an open-access business model.  For grant-funded research,
    the funding agency should underwrite reasonable publication charges for disseminating
    the results of the research; that''s part of the research process and should be
    folded into the funder''s costs.


    But, as you say, not all university research is grant-funded, and in some subject
    areas, grant funding is essentially nonexistent.  In those areas, the university
    itself is essentially acting as the funding agency.  When universities hire faculty
    in those areas to carry out research, they implicitly take on responsibility for
    the costs of that research, and that should include dissemination of the results
    as well.  So for non-grant-funded research, universities should commit to underwrite
    reasonable open-access publication charges.


    This is, in fact, the premise of the [Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity](http://oacompact.org/),
    which is already supported by Harvard, MIT, Cornell, and a growing number of other
    institutions.  I''ve given a fuller argument for the compact in [a previous article](http://bit.ly/4ocFRP),
    and other posts in this blog talk about various aspects.


    For researchers without access to funds, reputable journals will waive fees, as
    you point out.  And universities that do underwrite open-access publication fees
    typically support this by refusing to underwrite fees for journals that don''t
    have such a policy.  It may not feel good to apply for a waiver, but at least
    this approach — publication fees with waivers — allows everyone to both publish
    in and read from journals.  It feels much worse to be unable to read from journals
    because your library can''t afford the subscriptions, no?'

  content: '@Stuart: Thank you very much for the answers. I kinda agree with most
    of what you said. But again even though my research is generally well funded,
    neither the funding agency nor the university is willing to pay for OA publication
    of the papers that I publish outside my main (funded) line of research. Therefore,
    I normally publish them in subscription-based journals. However, I can see your
    point that one should not forget about the readers and I don''t. Many journals
    allow authors to post their last version of the manuscript on the webpage of their
    institute and I do post my papers online. Moreover, I have recently found out
    that my university has an agreement with Springer and they openly publish every
    manuscript coming from my university (and a whole lot of other partner universities)
    free of charge. That I think is perhaps a better approach. Universities can pay
    a lump-sum to the most relevant publishers and they will publish every manuscript
    coming from the university as OA. This sort of agreement allows me to make both
    my funded and non-funded research freely accessible.'

  content: Research fees sometimes cannot be paid due to lack of funding by the researchers
    or universities, but it is good that research papers can be published and fees
    waived so that results are freely accessible.

  content: '"But if any defect, all are worse off except for the defector.  In the
    case at hand, a cooperating institution underwrites hybrid fees, a defecting institution
    does not." It probably goes without saying that this concept becomes significantly
    more complicated when it applies to OA and the hybrid transition. Due to the competitive
    nature of humans and, by extension organizations, it may be difficult to form
    a smooth transition since their seems to be somewhat of an incentive to "milk"
    the system for what its worth while defecting. The "transparency" issue may add
    a further disincentive since one may wonder about the integrity of those receiving
    compensation. Having said that, I think there are a few known x factors that have
    enabled many cooperative endeavors to succeed; philanthropy and positive self
    interest being two. There are many examples of the "prisoner''s dilemma" being
    negated by the resolve of a few committed individuals or organizations to lock
    arms in plowing difficult ground. The flip side to the prisoner''s dilemma may
    be a sort of "hero''s opportunity" that inspires short term sacrifice for future
    gains. Maybe it''s why the Amish cooperate in harvesting their neighbors'' fields
    while corn is still standing in their own. Some folks just choose to do what''s
    right.'
