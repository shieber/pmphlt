  content: "UNIVERSAL OA SELF-ARCHIVING MANDATES WILL MOOT THE PROBLEM OF INELASTIC\
    \ DEMAND AND UNCONTROLLED INFLATION\n\nStuart asks:\n\n\"Do we continue the status\
    \ quo, which involves only supporting a business model known to be subject to\
    \ uncontrolled inflationary spirals, or do we experiment with new mechanisms that\
    \ have the potential to be economically sound and far more open to boot?\"\n\n\
    The answer is simple: The only reason the uncontrolled inflation of journal subscription\
    \ costs is a problem at all (and also the the reason the upward spiral continues\
    \ uncontrolled) is the university's inelastic demand and need for access to the\
    \ journal articles. \n\nHence the solution is for universities to provide Open\
    \ Access (free online access) to those articles, by mandating that they be self-archived\
    \ in their institutional repositories.\n\nUniversal OA self-archiving moots the\
    \ problem of uncontrolled subscription-cost inflation by putting an end to the\
    \ inelasticity of the demand: If your university cannot afford the subscription\
    \ price for journal X, cancel it. Your users will still have access to the OA\
    \ version.\n\nThere is no need for universities to try to reform journal economics\
    \ directly now. What is needed is universal OA self-archiving mandates from universities.\
    \ Focusing instead on journal reform is simply distracting from  and hence delaying\
    \ the fulfillment of this pressing need.\n\nHarvard should focus all its energy\
    \ and prestige on universalizing OA self-archiving mandates rather than dissipating\
    \ it superfluously on journal economics and OA funds.\n\nOnce OA self-archiving\
    \ is universal, journal economics will take care of itself.\n\nHarnad, S. (2007)\

    \nABSTRACT: What the research community needs, urgently, is free online access\
    \ (Open Access, OA) to its own peer-reviewed research output. Researchers can\
    \ provide that in two ways: by publishing their articles in OA journals (Gold\
    \ OA) or by continuing to publish in non-OA journals and self-archiving their\
    \ final peer-reviewed drafts in their own OA Institutional Repositories (Green\
    \ OA). OA self-archiving, once it is mandated by research institutions and funders,\
    \ can reliably generate 100% Green OA. Gold OA requires journals to convert to\
    \ OA publishing (which is not in the hands of the research community) and it also\
    \ requires the funds to cover the Gold OA publication costs. With 100% Green OA,\
    \ the research community's access and impact problems are already solved. If and\
    \ when 100% Green OA should cause significant cancellation pressure (no one knows\
    \ whether or when that will happen, because OA Green grows anarchically, article\
    \ by article, not journal by journal) then the cancellation pressure will cause\
    \ cost-cutting, downsizing and eventually a leveraged transition to OA (Gold)\
    \ publishing on the part of journals. As subscription revenues shrink, institutional\
    \ windfall savings from cancellations grow. If and when journal subscriptions\
    \ become unsustainable, per-article publishing costs will be low enough, and institutional\
    \ savings will be high enough to cover them, because publishing will have downsized\
    \ to just peer-review service provision alone, offloading text-generation onto\
    \ authors and access-provision and archiving onto the global network of OA Institutional\
    \ Repositories. Green OA will have leveraged a transition to Gold OA."
