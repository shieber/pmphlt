  content: "Professor Steven Hyman, the Provost of Harvard, has submitted such a spot-on,\
    \ point for point response to President Obama's Request for Information on Public\
    \ Access Policy that if his words are heeded, the beneficiaries will not only\
    \ be US research progress and the US tax-paying public, by whom US research is\
    \ funded and for whose benefit it is conducted, but research progress and its\
    \ public benefits planet-wide, as US policy is globally reciprocated.\n\nReproduced\
    \ below are just a few of the highlights of Professor Hyman's response. Every\
    \ one of the highlights has a special salience, and attests to the minute attention\
    \ and keen insight into the subtle details of Open Access that went into the preparation\
    \ of this invaluable statement.\n\n[Asterisks indicate three extremely minor points\
    \ on which the response could be ever so slightly strengthened -- see end.]\n\n\
    \"The public access policy should (1) be mandatory, not voluntary, (2) use the\
    \ shortest practical embargo period, no longer than six months, (3) apply to the\
    \ final version of the author’s peer-reviewed manuscript, as opposed to the published\
    \ version, unless the publisher consents to provide public access to the published\
    \ version, (4) *require deposit of the manuscript in a suitable open repository\
    \ [*] immediately upon acceptance for publication, where it would remain “dark”\
    \ until the embargo period expired, and (5) avoid copyright problems by **requiring\
    \ federal grantees, when publishing articles based on federally funded research,\
    \ to retain the right to give the relevant agency a non-exclusive license to distribute\
    \ a public-access copy of his or her peer-reviewed manuscript [**]...\n\n\"If\
    \ publishers believe they cannot afford to allow copies of their articles to be\
    \ released under a public-access policy, they need not publish federally funded\
    \ researchers. To date, however, it appears that no publishers have made that\
    \ decision in response to the NIH policy. Hence, federally funded authors remain\
    \ free to submit their work to the journals of their choice. Moreover, public\
    \ access gives authors a much larger audience and much greater impact...\n\n\"\
    If the United States extends a public-access mandate across the federal government,\
    \ then lay citizens with no interest in reading this literature for themselves\
    \ will benefit indirectly because researchers will benefit directly.... That is\
    \ the primary problem for which public access is the solution...\n\n\"It doesn’t\
    \ matter whether many lay readers, or few, are able to read peer-reviewed research\
    \ literature or have reason to do so. But even if there are many, the primary\
    \ beneficiaries of a public-access policy will be professional researchers, who\
    \ constitute the intended audience for this literature and who depend on access\
    \ to it for their own work....\n\n\"Among the metrics for measuring success, I\
    \ can propose these: the compliance rate (how many articles that the policy intends\
    \ to open up have actually been opened up); the number of downloads from the public-access\
    \ repositories; and the number of citations to the public-access articles. As\
    \ we use different metrics, we must accept that ***we will never have an adequate\
    \ control group: a set of articles on similar topics, of similar quality, for\
    \ which there is no public access[***]....\n\n---\n\nSuggestions for strengthening\
    \ the three minor points indicated by the asterisks:\n\n*\"require deposit of\
    \ the manuscript in a suitable open repository\" [*] \n\n(add: \"preferably the\
    \ fundee's own institutional repository\")\n\n**\"requiring federal grantees,\
    \ when publishing articles based on federally funded research, to retain the right\
    \ to give the relevant agency a non-exclusive license to distribute a public-access\
    \ copy of his or her peer-reviewed manuscript\" [**] \n\n(add: \"the rights retention\
    \ and license are desirable and welcome, but not necessary if the publisher already\
    \ endorses making the deposit publicly accessible immediately, or after the allowable\
    \ embargo period\")\n\n***we will never have an adequate control group [for measuring\
    \ the mandate's success]: a set of articles on similar topics, of similar quality,\
    \ for which there is no public access[***]\n\n(add: \"but closed-access articles\
    \ published in the same journal and year as mandatorily open-access articles do\
    \ provide an approximate matched control baseline for comparison\")"

  content: Why should there be a fear of public downloads from publishers. Demand
    needs to be met, and where there are increased downloads, this reflects a need
    being being met. Excellent post - bookmarked.

  content: It was mentioned that if publishers feel they can't afford to allow copies
    of their articles to be released under a public-access policy, they need not publish
    federally funded researchers. It appears that this is rarely the case. Freedom
    of information is vital to our democracy.

  content: 'A public access policy will not reduce the need for printers / publishers
    or the services they undertake. It will just prevent the products of our public
    investment in research from being stopped by publishers that provide access only
    to paying customers.

  content: '"First, taxpayers deserve access to the results of taxpayer-funded research....".
    I strongly agree to the well raised point. Taxpayer are non but the stake holder
    of the state and state is answerable to any action they take. I see no harm in
    sharing information with taxpayers which does not poses threat to nation security.'

  content: In response to the last comment, I think you fail to see the point.  The
    published editions are the cause of concern, as the taxpayers already would have
    access to that which would have been taxpayer funded (i.e. public works) but the
    published works (ala those that retain royalties and copyrights) would be redistributable
    only for citing authority.  I don't see how this model will harm publishers at
    all, they benefit from having an educated mass that buys their product.

  content: 'Dr. Diane DiEuliis advocates public access to publicly funded research
    .. Is that so unpopular ?


    Surely the hard pressed taxpayer is entitled to see the results of publicly funded
    research in every field .. it is a fundamental payback.'

    the public. Not least to ensure that public funds are being used appropriately...

  content: "The importance of what is being discussed and decided here literally impacts\
    \ the world, yet flies under the radar of most ordinary people like myself. While\
    \ it only seems to be common sense to make this information public and available,\
    \ what is the typical policy in other countries that actually fund research? \n\
    \nPublic access to all non-classified government funded research is in line with\
    \ the spirit of an open democratic society. Has there been a time when this was\
    \ not the case? As an outsider it is surprising that this is even an issue. The\
    \ more the general public, not just fellow researchers, are made aware and have\
    \ access to current research the more they will feel a part of a common and unified\
    \ society."

    issue then no funding.

  content: 'This is a great point:


    The embargo period (time between publication and public-access) should be as short
    as possible. Because the public has a strong interest in immediate access, any
    delay is a compromise, and we should not compromise the public interest any more
    than absolutely necessary.


    The timeframe should be a huge consideration because it speaks directly to the
    relevance of the information that can be disseminated.'

  content: It's simply about supply and demand in addition to reduced operating costs.
    Increased downloads represent a larger need to be filled. I agree that publicly
    funded research should be available to the public and this method fulfills the
    public's interest of having immediate access to these resources.

  content: Taxpayers should always have full access, and transparency and be the beneficiaries
    of taxpayer-funded research.  Why this information should be just accessible for
    a certain elite? It reminds me of a club where there´s different level of club
    members. Only the top level of club members has access to the club´s premises
    and services  but the lower level has to pay the same membership fees as well
    and get at maximum some "processed" information. The people require more honest
    information and transparency!
