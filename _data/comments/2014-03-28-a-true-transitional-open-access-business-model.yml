  content: Hi - intriguing ideas here, especially the voucher system. A complicating
    factor may be that most institutional libraries get most of their journals as
    bundled subscriptions, either from publishers, or from database vendors, not as
    individual journal subscriptions. This is further complicated by the fact that
    many license these collections as part of multi - institutional consortia. These
    are not insurmountable issues but they need to be considered.

  content: '@Margy: The natural extension to bundles and consortia would be to cover
    OA publication fees for authors at any institution in theconsortkum for articles
    in any journal in the bundle. As it turns out, this seems to be what the Austrian
    Science Fund has arranged with IOP (as mentioned in Falk Reckling''s comment).
    IOP doesn''t seem to provide this arrangement with all of its subscribers, however,
    so it remains primarily a hybrid, not transitional, publisher. (They do publish
    a couple of fully OA journals, *New Journal of Physics* and *Environmental Research
    Letters*.)


    There are still problems having to do with how the fee offsets would be allocated
    among the consortium members, especially when it gets to partially recovered articles.
    It certainly increases the complexity of the problem.'

    of course, completely consistent with publishers offering this transitional OA
    model.'

    IOP''s subscribers (and other publishers as well).'

  content: '@Roddy: It’s certainly a laudable effort to uncover open-access articles
    at hybrid journals – especially since the publishers themselves seem to do [all
    they can to hide their open-access status](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140319/11185526626/elsevier-still-charging-open-access-copies-two-years-after-it-was-told-problem.shtml)
    – but unfortunately, there’s a more fundamental problem here. A band-aid isn’t
    a cure for systemic illness.'
