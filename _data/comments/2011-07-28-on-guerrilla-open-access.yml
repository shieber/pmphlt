  content: 'NAPSTER REDUX


    There is a very simple way to distinguish the OA movement from piracy, bootleg
    and other "guerilla" movements. It was already pointed out in 2000 http://bit.ly/OA2000
    when "napster" was not yet the domesticated main-streamer that later re-appropriated
    the name http://bit.ly/napster2000 :


    "Author-end give-aways of their own digital products via self-archiving is the
    antithesis of consumer-end rip-offs of others'' non-give-away digital products
    via napster or gnutella.


    "It is very important to clearly distinguish and distance the two http://bit.ly/givetake
    because any inadvertent or willful conflation of the self-archiving initiative
    with napster can only retard the progress of the self-archiving initiative toward
    the optimal and inevitable.


    "(''Information is free'' is nonsense: There is and always was both give-away
    and non-give-away information. Steal the latter and you simply kill the incentive
    to provide it in the first place.)"'

  content: 'To clarify: JSTOR used to be supported by foundations (notably Mellon),
    but it''s currently supported by library dollars via subscription. This is how
    Mellon typically operates, offering startup money but insisting that the resulting
    service wean itself off that money as quickly as possible.


    I believe librarians and academics should start asking the Mellon Foundation hard
    questions about why their startup schemes invariably lead to toll-access databases...
    and make clear that we are prepared to support open-access ones at cost.'

  content: "@Dorothea: You are of course exactly right about JSTOR's funding history\
    \ and business model. And I too would be completely supportive of a JSTOR transition\
    \ to an open-access revenue model. It's well worth thinking through how this might\
    \ be done. (That's just what I mean about \"thoughtful efforts\".) \n\nBut it's\
    \ worth noting that there are hard unanswered questions to be resolved: What revenue\
    \ model would that be, and who is the \"we\" who are prepared to support it? To\
    \ date there is really no extant proven applicable OA model for a JSTOR. The publication-fee\
    \ model used by OA journals only applies where the costs can be tied to individual\
    \ authors. The crowdfunding models (Bloomsbury, gluejar) aren't applicable where\
    \ comprehensiveness of coverage is desired. The endowment model has only ever\
    \ been tried on a much smaller scale project, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\
    \ (Ithaka Harbors spends $30M on program services. Even if only a quarter of that\
    \ is running JSTOR, underwriting that would require an endowment of about $150M,\
    \ or about $1M per ARL library.) The SCOAP3 flipped model hasn't yet been successfully\
    \ deployed and has an unresolved free-rider problem, though if it actually takes\
    \ off and turns out to work, it could be the ideal model for an OA JSTOR.\n\n\
    In summary, we really need some creative thinking about how to open up access\
    \ to JSTOR and similar projects."

  content: 'SCOAP3 isn''t the only cooperative funding model being tried; look at
    Cornell and arXiv. Academic libraries are also moving a fair amount of their purchasing
    to consortial and other collaborative models, the logical extreme of which is
    "buy everything for everyone."


    I don''t mean to diminish the challenge here. I''m as disappointed as anyone that
    academic libraries haven''t started asking and answering "how do we free the literature?"
    questions.


    I do think there is potential, though, and I salute SCOAP3 and arXiv for blazing
    trail.'

  content: 'Just for the record, JSTOR DFR is a wonderful service but it can''t compete
    with full text access. There are many kinds of text/data mining that can''t be
    performed without the full text. Examples would include: coreference resolution
    and named entity recognition (finding people and place names mentioned in an article).


    I think if copyright was reformed---perhaps along lines suggested by Lessig or
    Boyle (~25 year term, once renewable), it might be saved from itself. I also think
    the chances of reform in the next ten to fifteen years are negligible. It really
    is an unfortunate situation, but certainly one that helps explain the energy of
    those advocating guerilla open access.'
