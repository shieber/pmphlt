    I have grown more and more tepid about so-called "author-pay" schemes in OA journals,
    and I have done so for a number of reasons. For one thing, waivers may be in place,
    but they are viewed as humiliating by authors who can still submit their articles
    to prestigious, yet toll-gated, journals. And they can do so without having to
    go through a painful request for special treatment. Every time I have tested this
    point with friends and colleagues in countries such as Brazil or India, the answer
    has been the same: it is not easy admitting you are poor. It is very difficult
    to beg.


    The second argument is that the author-pay scheme neglects a number of important
    facets of scientific publishing. It actually responds to a request for "sustainability"
    which, in my opinion, is simply misplaced. Why is it misplaced? Simply for the
    following sets of reasons:


    1. Scientific research is largely supported by public money, even in the US. In
    effect, industries in the world want to benefit from the largely pre-competitive
    results of fundamental research without paying for them. This means that, judged
    from standard economic criteria, scientific research is not sustainable. Yet,
    it has been going on since at least the 17th century, and probably earlier. Why?
    Simply because governments have found it important to ensure military and commercial
    advantages. In short, scientific research is not sustainable, but it is nonetheless
    viable (i.e. financially supported in a stable and constant way).


    2. Publishing, I believe we agree, is an integral part of the life-cycle of research.
    Then, if research is viable, but unsustainable, why ask that scientific publishing
    be sustainable? Making it financially viable should be sufficient.


    3. Scientific publishing costs between 1 and 2% of scientific research. Hence,
    extending financial support to scientific publishing should not unduly tax the
    budgets spent on scientific research.


    All this leads to a simple answer: scientific publishing should be financially
    supported by the same institutions and governments that support research. The
    mechanisms that could support such a scheme are varied, and libraries could be
    involved, especially as many of them are also supported by public money, but I
    will leave these details aside here. The point is that a system of scientific
    publishing can be developed that ensures free access to both potential authors
    and to readers.


    There is a good precedent for this: SciELO in Latin America and beyond. Recent
    rumours about the evolution of SciELO are ambiguous and leave me a little worried,
    but the track history of this project shows that several hundreds of journals
    have been able to mix the quest for high quality with complete free access for
    both readers and authors. This was achieved through direct subsidies to the journals,
    exactly like the rest of scientific research. And that is the way to go in my
    opinion.'

    We do not disagree as much as you may think. Your worry is not about article-processing
    fees per se *but about authors having to pay them*. You would prefer that research
    funders pay them. I agree completely.


    Funders should put in place policies that commit them to paying reasonable open-access
    article-processing fees on behalf of their funded authors. For research that is
    not funded by a specific granting agency — much research outside the sciences
    is implicitly funded by a university or research institution paying the salary
    and providing the facilities for a scholar — the university or research institution
    should pay the article-processing fees. This is exactly what [COPE](http://oacompact.org/)
    promotes.


    For the cases where neither of these options are available, a waiver of the fee
    is a reasonable fallback position. But I too think it should be a last recourse
    for non-grant-funded or institution-supported work.'
