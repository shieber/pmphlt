    AND JOURNALS


    The number of "publishers cooperating with the Harvard OA policy" has for some
    time now been a good deal larger than the number on the OSC list so far. I am
    sure the rest of these publishers and journals will eventually be on the OSC list,
    but for authors eager to have a more up-to-date list, see Romeo (both the SHERPA
    version and EPrints more focused rendering:  268 publishers (publishing 6440 journals,
    63% of the c. 10,000 whose policies are so far registered in Romeo) are GREEN,
    meaning that they endorse Open Access self-archiving of the author''s final, peer-reviewed
    draft, immediately upon acceptance for publication.


    Although there is a slight overlap between Romeo''s 6440 GREEN journals and DOAJ''s
    4289 GOLD journals (which make their online edition immediately OA) http://www.doaj.org/
    most of the GOLD journals are not covered by Romeo, hence should be added to the
    Romeo GREEN list, as all GOLD journals are a-fortiori also GREEN!


    A further 61 publishers (publish a further 3228 journals, 32%) are "PALE-GREEN,"
    meaning they endorse immediate OA self-archiving of the author''s pre-acceptance
    drafts, but they request an OA embargo for the final draft of 6-12 months or more.'
