  content: "This article was an excellent analysis of the Open Access models and the\
    \ Finch report.\n\nthere are two key aspects missing:\nOne is that the author-side\
    \ market structure can price out researchers from \na) poorer countries\nb) poorer\
    \ research groups/universities\nIn the long run (by pricing out good work from\
    \ relatively cash poor authors) author-side economics will have detrimental effect\
    \ on scholarship at large and enhance the north-south divide.\n\nSecondly, in\
    \ the absence of watchdogs, strong international law and industry regulators collusion\
    \ between publishers to form cartels is a possibility. the international nature\
    \ of research publishing will further make it difficult to regulate this market.\
    \ As a result we may well see perverse effects such as publishers (technical societies\
    \ or specialist niche publishers) artificially keeping prices higher using their\
    \ established imprimatur to extract higher profits.\n\nAny really sustainable\
    \ and equitable model needs to address the concerns of readers, authors, funders\
    \ and publishers, without pricing anyone out."

  content: 'Your worry about open-access publication fees disenfranchising researchers
    with fewer resources is important. I’ve addressed it at length in a post “[Are
    open-access fees disenfranchising?](http://bit.ly/hXCqld)”, where I conclude that
    “With open access, we can enfranchise both the readers and the writers of the
    scholarly literature. We can, and we should.”


    With respect to my proposals in reaction to the Finch report, by the way, note
    that unlike the Finch proposal, I would not require publication in gold open-access
    or hybrid journals. Rather, I propose requiring open access either through gold
    *or green*, and allowing for funder payment of gold (but not hybrid) fees if that
    (optional) route is taken. I believe that such an approach does “address the concerns
    of readers, authors, funders and publishers, without pricing anyone out.”'
