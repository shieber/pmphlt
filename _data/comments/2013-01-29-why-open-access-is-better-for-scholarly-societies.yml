  content: I see one big problem with your argument, but it's possible you've addressed
    it and I'm missing it.  For small/medium sized societies who publish only the
    very best in their field, it would be impossible (as I see it) to maintain that
    level of quality.  Typically the top journals in their field accept about 10%
    (give or take) of submitted manuscripts.  The larger, successful OA publishers,
    PLoS is the prime example, accept 65-70% of all submissions.  Their explanation
    that they accept research which is "sound" regardless of perceived impact on the
    field, sounds nice.  However, I've yet to see an OA model which allows a journal
    to remain selective in what they publish that is also financially viable.  The
    numbers just don't add up.  I suspect this is the real reason, or at least a big
    one, such a high percentage is accepted by the "mega" OA journals.  So, societies
    considering a conversion to OA should consider if they are willing to sacrifice
    how selective they are and if this lowers the quality of their publications.  If
    they still wish to move to OA and remain selective, then they must be confident
    they can make up lost revenue from some other stream beside publishing.  There
    is NO WAY (that I see) a journal can be highly selective and survive on APC fees.  There's
    the rub.

  content: 'First, a correction: Although *PLoS ONE*, PLoS''s "megajournal", has a
    relatively high acceptance rate,  PLoS''s flagship journals *PLoS Biology* and
    *PLoS Medicine* are highly selective, and their community journals are also quite
    selective. In fact, there are many selective OA journals that are viable on APCs,
    this despite the fact that (as I argued in the post) OA journals are currently
    at a systematic disadvantage as compared to subscription journals.


    There is nothing in principle that says that moving a journal to OA must inherently
    involve a reduction in selectivity to retain sustainability. The reason that OA
    journals can remain sustainable at high levels of selectivity --- so there is
    no "race to the bottom" --- is that *journals of higher selectivity can charge
    higher APCs*, to compensate for the opportunity cost of the APCs from rejected
    articles. Conversely, reducing selectivity may actually harm the finances of a
    journal if it reduces the journal''s ability to command high APCs. I''ve shown
    [in a previous post](http://bit.ly/3ZTgRt) that this positive correlation between
    selectivity and APC holds in practice. In fact, there are many high quality sustainable
    OA journals. The "[Cost Effectiveness for Open Access Journals](http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/)"
    visualization from eigenfactor.org provides a convenient way of exploring OA journals
    to find examples. And it incidentally corroborates my earlier finding of positive
    correlation between fee and quality.'

  content: You're correct about PLoS ONE vs. the other PLoS journals, however I still
    feel that without PLoS ONE, PLoS wouldn't be financially sustainable.  I will
    need to take a look at the links you've provided (thank you), but I am highly
    skeptical that APCs can really be raised to the level needed for an OA journal
    to stay afloat without a dramatic increase in acceptance rate, and that makes
    me very nervous.

  content: 'Excellent post!

    I''d only like to add one important detail (also with respect to some of the comments
    above): there is no evidence backing up the notion of any inherent difference
    in ''quality'' between journals. We have recently surveyed the empirical literature
    on the mater and at best, journal rank is not predictive of ''quality'' if all
    the available metrics are taken into account. If anything, a trend can be observed
    that - counterintuitively - the science published in high ranking journals has
    a higher chance of being of ''lesser'' quality than that published in lower ranking
    journals:

    http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3748


    I think the data you present make it unambiguously clear that corporate publishers
    are overcharging the public purse for their services. Bibliometric data are equally
    unambiguous that the ranking of journals is like homeopathy, astrology or dowsing:
    subjectively, we might feel inclined to trust any personally experienced effects,
    but these effects disappear upon scientific scrutiny.'

  content: 'Thanks for a very informative post, in fact the best I''ve seen yet on
    the economics of scholarly publishing.


    I''d like to respond to Adam Etkin''s point that "There is NO WAY (that I see)
    a journal can be highly selective and survive on APC fees." There is a way: a
    small fee charged for all authors who submit to the journal, even if their paper
    is rejected (combined with APCs). Few journals use this mechanism at the moment,
    but for a highly selective journal it seems feasible to me. The main barrier to
    journals charging submission fees may be simply that none of them want to be the
    first to try it. I''ve reviewed the pros and cons of submission fees on my blog
    at https://sharmanedit.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/submission-fees/'

  content: 'Very interesting and thought-provoking article!  Though there''s one important
    bit where we need to talk through things a little further.


    In the "transition" section, you say


    "When there are both kinds of journals in the market, both subscription journals
    and open-access journals, the open-access journals are at a competitive disadvantage
    [from the author''s point of view]."


    But it''s not clear to me that we''re going to end up in a state where this is
    *not* the case.  If subscription journals don''t go away altogether (and why would
    they, if they''re at an advantage for attracting authors, and libraries are still
    buying *some* things?), then open-access journals need to be viable over the long
    term in a mixed journal economy.  Or, OA journals need to develop enough of a
    comparative advantage that subscription journals become a small part of the scholarly
    commmunications process that doesn''t threaten OA or library budgets (even if
    new subscription journals come along).


    I can think of some possible ways this shift in OA journal viability and attractiveness
    could happen, though they''re by no means sure things.  We should discuss how
    this transition could work, because unless there are some further changes to the
    way scholarly communication is conducted and funded, I don''t see "all scholarly
    journals are open access" as a stable equilibrium.'

  content: Anna, thank you for the response.  Charging submission fees, in my opinion,
    will only result in a very small additional revenue stream.  Nothing that would
    have a large enough impact to be sustainable long term.  Also, remember this blog
    specifically speaks to Societies.  Are organizations going to start charging submission
    fees on top of membership dues?  Is the fee waived or reduced for members?  It's
    a good idea, one already in use by both NFPs and for-profit publishers, but again
    I do not think revenue from this area makes much of a difference.

  content: 'Very informative article, but Shieber seems to forget about one important
    problem: He says that "(with OA) pricing is controlled not at the level of the
    bundle of journals. You don’t care about the bundle of the publisher when you’re
    an author submitting to a journal. You care about the journal."

    But of course commercial publishers are interested in selling OA services to authors
    or their proxies in bundles as well: What we''ll see increasingly is Elsevier
    and the like offering universities discounts on APCs if the universities pay on
    the basis of the number of their employees (or similar measures). Universities
    may feel they have to accept these offers, and in practice this may mean that
    if I publish in an Elsevier journal, I can do so without paying at all, whereas
    if I want to publish in a small nonprofit OA journal, I have to pay it out of
    my own research budget. So there will continue to be pressure on scholarly associations
    to join the big players, and they can continue to sell their journals in bundles.

  content: 'Adam,

    You raise an important point. I would argue that the OA model usefully highlights
    the expense and profligacy involved in running a high-calibre journal which rejects
    90% of all articles, if nothing is done to ensure that an outlet exists for the
    significant subset of the rejected articles which are scientifically sound and
    (after suitable revision) suitable for publication, just not in the highest-ranked
    journal.


    BioMed Central helps societies to efficiently manage transfer of a subset of rejected
    articles (including the peer review reports) from their high rejection rate titles,
    for consideration by more inclusive sister titles. This provides an improved experience
    for authors, makes more efficient use of reviewer and editor time, and ensures
    that the economics of open access publication work for the society and the publisher,
    even in the case of high rejection-rate flagship journals.'

  content: '" As a library, what are you going to do? Cancel scholarly society journals,
    just as the societies have been rightly complaining about."


    Stuart, do you have data to back this claim? Are society journals really under
    stress more than commercial journals? From what I see with ACM the pressure comes
    from members, not from libraries.'
