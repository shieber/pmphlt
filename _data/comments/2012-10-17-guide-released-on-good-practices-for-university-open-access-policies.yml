  content: "Dear Pr. Shieber,\nI've came accross that blog post http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/why-ive-joined-the-bad-guys/\n\
    about the practice of making authors/institution pay to get their articles processed\
    \ as much as 500$.\nGiven your implication into the open access debate,  you might\
    \ find it interesting.  \nI have to say that I don't see French institution willing\
    \ to pay that much to get papers published but still they pay thousands of euros\
    \ each year to get people presenting their papers abroad.. so who knows.\n\nBest\
    \ regards and happy new year,\n\nDjamé"

  content: French institutions, and institutions the world over, already pay more
    than $500 per article published in subscription journals. The average revenue
    per article for subscription journals is about $5,000. Compared to that, $500
    per article is a bargain. (See [a previous post](http://bit.ly/9HhQJz) for further
    information.)
