  content: There are a number of non-sequiturs in this article. For example, that
    raising the publication charge requires a lowering of standards. The article essentially
    sets up the "straw man" that OA = vanity publishing only to then demolish it.
    Not very surprising really!

  content: "Apologies. My post (no. 8) is misleading. \n\nI most certainly DO agree\
    \ with Shieber's overall conclusion that author-pays OA is not vanity publishing.\
    \ I just think his reasoning and some of his assertions are flawed. For example\
    \ the notion that raising author charges requires a lowering of standards. This\
    \ is palpably false (check out Cell Press, for example!)."
