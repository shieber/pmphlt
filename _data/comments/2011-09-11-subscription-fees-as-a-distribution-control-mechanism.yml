    The attempt to "protect" the public from the misuse of research information by
    bad people or to make corporations "pay their fair share" is disingenuous at best,
    and more likely simply an attempt to engender class envy in order to distract
    the public from the fact that "we" aren''t allowed to know.


    In an open and free society, you cannot guarantee safety or equality, only the
    opportunity to succeed or fail by your own works.'
