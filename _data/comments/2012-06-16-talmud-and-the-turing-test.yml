  content: Although body "language" conveys a lot, surely it was language that gave
    our species the unique power to read minds. But language itself is grounded in
    a lot of antecedent bodily powers that are best described as "robotic." Turing's
    subtle and prescient test draws upon them all.

  content: 'Is the talmudic reference unique anyway? Isn''t it just a general, common-sense
    interpretation, revealing no special thought or knowledge at all?


    Also, I wonder if the closest you can get to something like a Golem is an encounter
    with an ape, like a gorilla or a chimp? I can imagine people trying to decide
    what it is for the first time, and when it doesn''t make any kind of speech, deciding
    that it''s not  like a human. Surely there are records of such encounters in some
    of the old texts?'
