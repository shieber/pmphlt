  content: "Like many, I have been reflecting deeply on the implications of Swartz's\
    \ actions, and I was only recently struck by something that seems worth noting,\
    \ as it has not been discussed elsewhere. \n\nIn his \"Guerilla Open Access Manifesto\"\
    \ Swartz specifically states that his project of uploading materials refers to\
    \ works that are \"out of copyright,\" and in numerous statements elsewhere he\
    \ states that he is a strong believer in copyright protection. \n\nThis doesn't\
    \ seem to have registered with commentators prior to the events of 2011, and no\
    \ doubt Swartz himself is partly to blame, as he had a tendency to formulate even\
    \ the most moderate of visions in radical terms (part of his brilliance). \n\n\
    My guess is that he never at any point intended to distribute anything that was\
    \ copyright-protected. His idea, I think was to upload public domain materials,\
    \ and the \"secret archives\" seem to refer to the government archives which he\
    \ made publicly available just a few months later. These materials were not really\
    \ secret, they were just behind a paywall, so calling them secret was a bit rhetorical.\
    \ This act of his--not the JSTOR incident--is widely regarded as a public service\
    \ that didn't have negative consequences. I don't think his idea in the manifesto\
    \ was to encourage people to violate any federal law. \n\nAlas, Swartz was never\
    \ given the chance to explain himself. But this reading seems to me consistent\
    \ with his writings and lectures."
